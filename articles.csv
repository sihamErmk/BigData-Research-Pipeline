They have more compute capacity than the edge but much less so than cloud data centers. They typically have high uptime and always-on Internet connectivity. Applications that make use of the fog can avoid the network performance limitation of cloud computing while being less resource constrained than edge computing. As a result, they offer a useful balance of the current paradigms. This article explores various aspects of fog computing in the context of big data.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:09:32.250000
6967958c73e3d10bb1b0b5a5,arXiv,Big Data,Data Encoding for Byzantine-Resilient Distributed Optimization,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02664v2,"Deepesh Data, Linqi Song, Suhas Diggavi",2019,"We study distributed optimization in the presence of Byzantine adversaries, where both data and computation are distributed among $m$ worker machines, $t$ of which may be corrupt. The compromised nodes may collaboratively and arbitrarily deviate from their pre-specified programs, and a designated (master) node iteratively computes the model/parameter vector for generalized linear models. In this work, we primarily focus on two iterative algorithms: Proximal Gradient Descent (PGD) and Coordinate Descent (CD). Gradient descent (GD) is a special case of these algorithms. PGD is typically used in the data-parallel setting, where data is partitioned across different samples, whereas, CD is used in the model-parallelism setting, where data is partitioned across the parameter space.
  In this paper, we propose a method based on data encoding and error correction over real numbers to combat adversarial attacks. We can tolerate up to $t\leq \lfloor\frac{m-1}{2}\rfloor$ corrupt worker nodes, which is information-theoretically optimal. We give deterministic guarantees, and our method does not assume any probability distribution on the data. We develop a {\em sparse} encoding scheme which enables computationally efficient data encoding and decoding. We demonstrate a trade-off between the corruption threshold and the resource requirements (storage, computational, and communication complexity). As an example, for $t\leq\frac{m}{3}$, our scheme incurs only a {\em constant} overhead on these resources, over that required by the plain distributed PGD/CD algorithms which provide no adversarial protection. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper that makes CD secure against adversarial attacks.
  Our encoding scheme extends efficiently to the data streaming model and for stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We also give experimental results to show the efficacy of our proposed schemes.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:09:32.268000

Coull, Christopher Gardner",2019,"Feature engineering is one of the most costly aspects of developing effective machine learning models, and that cost is even greater in specialized problem domains, like malware classification, where expert skills are necessary to identify useful features. Recent work, however, has shown that deep learning models can be used to automatically learn feature representations directly from the raw, unstructured bytes of the binaries themselves. In this paper, we explore what these models are learning about malware. To do so, we examine the learned features at multiple levels of resolution, from individual byte embeddings to end-to-end analysis of the model. At each step, we connect these byte-oriented activations to their original semantics through parsing and disassembly of the binary to arrive at human-understandable features. Through our results, we identify several interesting features learned by the model and their connection to manually-derived features typically used by traditional machine learning models. Additionally, we explore the impact of training data volume and regularization on the quality of the learned features and the efficacy of the classifiers, revealing the somewhat paradoxical insight that better generalization does not necessarily result in better performance for byte-based malware classifiers.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:09:38.350000

Putting it to use carries the tempting promise to make the intermediaries of social interactions superfluous and furthermore keep secure track of all interactions. Currently intermediaries such as banks and notaries are necessary and must be trusted, which creates great dependencies, as the financial crisis of 2008 painfully demonstrated. Especially banks and notaries are said to become dispensable as a result of using the blockchain. But in real-world applications of the blockchain, the power of central actors does not dissolve, it only shifts to new, democratically illegitimate, uncontrolled or even uncontrollable power centers.

Lye, Siddhartha Mishra, Deep Ray",2019,"Many large scale problems in computational fluid dynamics such as uncertainty quantification, Bayesian inversion, data assimilation and PDE constrained optimization are considered very challenging computationally as they require a large number of expensive (forward) numerical solutions of the corresponding PDEs. We propose a machine learning algorithm, based on deep artificial neural networks, that predicts the underlying \emph{input parameters to observable} map from a few training samples (computed realizations of this map). By a judicious combination of theoretical arguments and empirical observations, we find suitable network architectures and training hyperparameters that result in robust and efficient neural network approximations of the parameters to observable map. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate low prediction errors for the trained network networks, even when the network has been trained with a few samples, at a computational cost which is several orders of magnitude lower than the underlying PDE solver.
  Moreover, we combine the proposed deep learning algorithm with Monte Carlo (MC) and Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods to efficiently compute uncertainty propagation for nonlinear PDEs. Under the assumption that the underlying neural networks generalize well, we prove that the deep learning MC and QMC algorithms are guaranteed to be faster than the baseline (quasi-) Monte Carlo methods.

We theoretically characterize this behavior and analyze how different evidential activations influence learning dynamics. Building on this analysis, we design a general family of activation functions and corresponding evidential regularizers that provide an alternative pathway for consistent evidence updates across activation regimes.

In this work, we proposed a new training data-independent framework, called Deep Contextual Features Learning (DeepCFL), to perform image synthesis and image restoration based on the semantics of the input image. The contextual features are simply the high dimensional vectors representing the semantics of the given image. DeepCFL is a single image GAN framework that learns the distribution of the context vectors from the input image.

This constraint often leads to inferior predictive performance compared to standard softmax models, making it challenging to extend them to many large-scale datasets. To unveil the real cause of this undesired behavior, we theoretically investigate evidential models and identify a fundamental limitation that explains the inferior performance: existing evidential activation functions create zero evidence regions, which prevent the model to learn from training samples falling into such regions.

Learning curves have important applications in several machine learning contexts, most notably in data acquisition, early stopping of model training, and model selection. For instance, learning curves can be used to model the performance of the combination of an algorithm and its hyperparameter configuration, providing insights into their potential suitability at an early stage and often expediting the algorithm selection process. Various learning curve models have been proposed to use learning curves for decision making. Some of these models answer the binary decision question of whether a given algorithm at a certain budget will outperform a certain reference performance, whereas more complex models predict the entire learning curve of an algorithm. We contribute a framework that categorises learning curve approaches using three criteria: the decision-making situation they address, the intrinsic learning curve question they answer and the type of resources they use. We survey papers from the literature and classify them into this framework.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:22.399000

In this research, we conducted a benchmark study to assess the performance of different applicable machine learning approaches on three different datasets where we accumulated the largest and most diversified one. We explored a number of advanced pre-trained language models for fake news detection along with the traditional and deep learning ones and compared their performances from different aspects for the first time to the best of our knowledge. We find that BERT and similar pre-trained models perform the best for fake news detection, especially with very small dataset. Hence, these models are significantly better option for languages with limited electronic contents, i.e., training data.

Chawla",2017,"From medical charts to national census, healthcare has traditionally operated under a paper-based paradigm. However, the past decade has marked a long and arduous transformation bringing healthcare into the digital age. Ranging from electronic health records, to digitized imaging and laboratory reports, to public health datasets, today, healthcare now generates an incredible amount of digital information. Such a wealth of data presents an exciting opportunity for integrated machine learning solutions to address problems across multiple facets of healthcare practice and administration. Unfortunately, the ability to derive accurate and informative insights requires more than the ability to execute machine learning models. Rather, a deeper understanding of the data on which the models are run is imperative for their success. While a significant effort has been undertaken to develop models able to process the volume of data obtained during the analysis of millions of digitalized patient records, it is important to remember that volume represents only one aspect of the data. In fact, drawing on data from an increasingly diverse set of sources, healthcare data presents an incredibly complex set of attributes that must be accounted for throughout the machine learning pipeline. This chapter focuses on highlighting such challenges, and is broken down into three distinct components, each representing a phase of the pipeline. We begin with attributes of the data accounted for during preprocessing, then move to considerations during model building, and end with challenges to the interpretation of model output. For each component, we present a discussion around data as it relates to the healthcare domain and offer insight into the challenges each may impose on the efficiency of machine learning techniques.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:22.436000

Learned theories are represented in the form of rules as declarative descriptions of obtained knowledge. In earlier work, the authors provided the first evidence of a measurable increase in human comprehension based on machine-learned logic rules for simple classification tasks. In a later study, it was found that the presentation of machine-learned explanations to humans can produce both beneficial and harmful effects in the context of game learning. We continue our investigation of comprehensibility by examining the effects of the ordering of concept presentations on human comprehension. In this work, we examine the explanatory effects of curriculum order and the presence of machine-learned explanations for sequential problem-solving. We show that 1) there exist tasks A and B such that learning A before B has a better human comprehension with respect to learning B before A and 2) there exist tasks A and B such that the presence of explanations when learning A contributes to improved human comprehension when subsequently learning B. We propose a framework for the effects of sequential teaching on comprehension based on an existing definition of comprehensibility and provide evidence for support from data collected in human trials. Empirical results show that sequential teaching of concepts with increasing complexity a) has a beneficial effect on human comprehension and b) leads to human re-discovery of divide-and-conquer problem-solving strategies, and c) studying machine-learned explanations allows adaptations of human problem-solving strategy with better performance.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:22.438000

There is a growing divide in approaches to building systems: on the one hand, programming leverages human experts to define a system while on the other hand behavior is learned from data in machine learning. We propose to hybridize these two by providing a 3-call API which we expose through an object called SmartChoice. We describe the SmartChoices-interface, how it can be used in programming with minimal code changes, and demonstrate that it is an easy to use but still powerful tool by demonstrating improvements over not using ML at all on three algorithmic problems: binary search, QuickSort, and caches. In these three examples, we replace the commonly used heuristics with an ML model entirely encapsulated within a SmartChoice and thus requiring minimal code changes. As opposed to previous work applying ML to algorithmic problems, our proposed approach does not require to drop existing implementations but seamlessly integrates into the standard software development workflow and gives full control to the software developer over how ML methods are applied. Our implementation relies on standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. To learn faster, we use the heuristic function, which they are replacing, as an initial function. We show how this initial function can be used to speed up and stabilize learning while providing a safety net that prevents performance to become substantially worse -- allowing for a safe deployment in critical applications in real life.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:22.478000

Our work encapsulates representation methods using a subsampling approach, such as node2vec, into a single unifying framework.

Additionally, we assess the impact of approximating the GW signal using the general relativistic effective potential (GREP) on EOS classification. We find that models trained on GREP data exhibit low classification accuracy. However, normalizing time by the peak signal frequency, which partially compensates for the absence of the time dilation effect in GREP, leads to a notable improvement in accuracy.

In some applications, such models are as accurate as non-interpretable ones, and thus are preferred for their transparency. Even when they are not accurate, they may still be preferred when interpretability is of paramount importance. However, restricting machine learning to interpretable models is often a severe limitation. In this paper we argue for explaining machine learning predictions using model-agnostic approaches.

Our goal is to show that AutoML can go further: it is possible today to automatically discover complete machine learning algorithms just using basic mathematical operations as building blocks. We demonstrate this by introducing a novel framework that significantly reduces human bias through a generic search space. Despite the vastness of this space, evolutionary search can still discover two-layer neural networks trained by backpropagation. These simple neural networks can then be surpassed by evolving directly on tasks of interest, e.g. CIFAR-10 variants, where modern techniques emerge in the top algorithms, such as bilinear interactions, normalized gradients, and weight averaging.

However, ML has a strong ontology - in which only the data exist - and a strong epistemology - in which a model is considered good if it performs well on held-out training data. These philosophies are in strong conflict with both standard practices and key philosophies in the natural sciences. Here we identify some locations for ML in the natural sciences at which the ontology and epistemology are valuable. For example, when an expressive machine learning model is used in a causal inference to represent the effects of confounders, such as foregrounds, backgrounds, or instrument calibration parameters, the model capacity and loose philosophy of ML can make the results more trustworthy. We also show that there are contexts in which the introduction of ML introduces strong, unwanted statistical biases. For one, when ML models are used to emulate physical (or first-principles) simulations, they amplify confirmation biases. For another, when expressive regressions are used to label datasets, those labels cannot be used in downstream joint or ensemble analyses without taking on uncontrolled biases.

The goal of GBS20 will be an ASIC that employs two serializers each from the 10.24 Gbps lpGBT SerDes, sharing the PLL also from lpGBT. A PAM4 encoder plus a VCSEL driver will be implemented in the same die to use the same clock system, eliminating the need of CDRs in the PAM4 encoder. This way the transmitter module, GBT20, developed using the GBS20 ASIC, will have the exact lpGBT data interface and transmission protocol, with an output up to 20.48 Gbps over one fiber. With PAM4 embedded FPGAs at the receiving end, GBT20 will halve the fibers needed in a system and better use the input bandwidth of the FPGA. A prototype, GBS20v0 is fabricated using a commercial 65 nm CMOS technology. This prototype has two serializers and a PAM4 encoder sharing the lpGBT PLL, but no user data input. An internal PRBS generator provides data to the serializers. GBS20v0 is tested barely up to 20.48 Gbps. With lessons learned from this prototype, we are designing the second prototype, GBS20v1, that will have 16 user data input channels each at 1.28 Gbps.

Donoho",2019,"Modern data science research can involve massive computational experimentation; an ambitious PhD in computational fields may do experiments consuming several million CPU hours. Traditional computing practices, in which researchers use laptops or shared campus-resident resources, are inadequate for experiments at the massive scale and varied scope that we now see in data science. On the other hand, modern cloud computing promises seemingly unlimited computational resources that can be custom configured, and seems to offer a powerful new venue for ambitious data-driven science. Exploiting the cloud fully, the amount of work that could be completed in a fixed amount of time can expand by several orders of magnitude.
  As potentially powerful as cloud-based experimentation may be in the abstract, it has not yet become a standard option for researchers in many academic disciplines. The prospect of actually conducting massive computational experiments in today's cloud systems confronts the potential user with daunting challenges. Leading considerations include: (i) the seeming complexity of today's cloud computing interface, (ii) the difficulty of executing an overwhelmingly large number of jobs, and (iii) the difficulty of monitoring and combining a massive collection of separate results. Starting a massive experiment `bare-handed' seems therefore highly problematic and prone to rapid `researcher burn out'.
  New software stacks are emerging that render massive cloud experiments relatively painless. Such stacks simplify experimentation by systematizing experiment definition, automating distribution and management of tasks, and allowing easy harvesting of results and documentation. In this article, we discuss several painless computing stacks that abstract away the difficulties of massive experimentation, thereby allowing a proliferation of ambitious experiments for scientific discovery.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:24.568000

During the last decades, political science has accumulated a large corpus of various kinds of data such as comprehensive factbooks and atlases, characterizing all or most of existing states by multiple and objectively assessed numerical indicators within certain time lapse. As a consequence, there exists a continuous trend for political science to gradually become a more quantitative scientific field and to use quantitative information in the analysis and reasoning. It is believed that any objective analysis in political science must be multidimensional and combine various sources of quantitative information; however, human capabilities for perception of large massifs of numerical information are limited. Hence, methods and approaches for visualization of quantitative and qualitative data (and, especially multivariate data) is an extremely important topic. Data visualization approaches can be classified into several groups, starting from creating informative charts and diagrams (statistical graphics and infographics) and ending with advanced statistical methods for visualizing multidimensional tables containing both quantitative and qualitative information.

Elastic principal graph is a computationally efficient and flexible data approximator based on embedding a graph into the data space and minimizing the energy functional penalizing the deviation of graph nodes both from data points and from pluri-harmonic configuration (generalization of linearity). The structure of principal graph is learned from data by application of a topological grammar which in the simplest case leads to the construction of principal curves or trees. In order to more efficiently cope with noise and outliers, here we suggest using a trimmed data approximation term to increase the robustness of the method. The modification of the method that we suggest does not affect either computational efficiency or general convergence properties of the original elastic graph method. The trimmed elastic energy functional remains a Lyapunov function for the optimization algorithm. On several examples of complex data distributions we demonstrate how the robust principal graphs learn the global data structure and show the advantage of using the trimmed data approximation term for the construction of principal graphs and other popular data approximators.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:24.575000

An important measure of the modeling progress is whether a model can generate code that can correctly execute to solve the task. However, due to the lack of an evaluation dataset that directly supports execution-based model evaluation, existing work relies on code surface form similarity metrics (e.g., BLEU, CodeBLEU) for model selection, which can be inaccurate.
  To remedy this, we introduce ExeDS, an evaluation dataset for execution evaluation for data science code generation tasks. ExeDS contains a set of 534 problems from Jupyter Notebooks, each consisting of code context, task description, reference program, and the desired execution output. With ExeDS, we evaluate the execution performance of five state-of-the-art code generation models that have achieved high surface-form evaluation scores. Our experiments show that models with high surface-form scores do not necessarily perform well on execution metrics, and execution-based metrics can better capture model code generation errors.

The most important result is a complete and continuous classification of all finite clouds of unordered points under rigid motion in any Euclidean space. The key challenge was to avoid the exponential complexity arising from permutations of the given unordered points. For a fixed dimension of the ambient Euclidean space, the times of all algorithms for the resulting invariants and distance metrics depend polynomially on the number of points.
  The second part of the book advances a similar classification in the much more difficult case of periodic point sets, which model all periodic crystals at the atomic scale. The most significant result is the hierarchy of invariants from the ultra-fast to complete ones. The key challenge was to resolve the discontinuity of crystal representations that break down under almost any noise. Experimental validation on all major materials databases confirmed the Crystal Isometry Principle: any real periodic crystal has a unique location in a common moduli space of all periodic structures under rigid motion.

The clients, instead of communicating with the central server in every iteration, maintain their local models, which they update by taking several SGD iterations based on their own datasets and then communicate the net update with the server, thereby achieving communication-efficiency. Furthermore, only a subset of clients communicate with the server, and this subset may be different at different synchronization times. The Byzantine clients may collaborate and send arbitrary vectors to the server to disrupt the learning process. To combat the adversary, we employ an efficient high-dimensional robust mean estimation algorithm from Steinhardt et al.~\cite[ITCS 2018]{Resilience_SCV18} at the server to filter-out corrupt vectors; and to analyze the outlier-filtering procedure, we develop a novel matrix concentration result that may be of independent interest.

We present mechanisms that can help in achieving this notion for functions that had no meaningful differentially private mechanisms previously.

While it is known that information theoretically secure MPC is possible among $n$ users (connected by secure and noiseless links and have access to private randomness) against the collusion of less than $n/2$ users in the honest-but-curious model, relatively less is known about the communication and randomness complexity of secure computation.
  In this work, we employ information theoretic techniques to obtain lower bounds on the amount of communication and randomness required for secure MPC. We restrict ourselves to a concrete interactive setting involving 3 users under which all functions are securely computable against corruption of a single user in the honest-but-curious model. We derive lower bounds for both the perfect security case (i.e., zero-error and no leakage of information) and asymptotic security (where the probability of error and information leakage vanish as block-length goes to $\infty$).
  Our techniques include the use of a data processing inequality for residual information (i.e., the gap between mutual information and Gács-Körner common information), a new information inequality for 3-user protocols, and the idea of distribution switching. Our lower bounds are shown to be tight for various functions of interest. In particular, we show concrete functions which have ""communication-ideal"" protocols, i.e., which achieve the minimum communication simultaneously on all links in the network, and also use minimum amount of randomness. Also, we obtain the first explicit example of a function that incurs a higher communication cost than the input length in the secure computation model of ""Feige, Kilian, and Naor [STOC, 1994]"", who had shown that such functions exist.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:24.641000

The impact of this issue in applied nuclear science has been discussed widely in recent years. Commonly suggested causes are: poor estimates of specific error components, neglect of uncertainty correlations, and overlooked known error sources. However, instances have been reported where very careful, objective assessments of all known error sources have been made with realistic error magnitudes and correlations provided, yet the resulting evaluated uncertainties still appear to be inconsistent with observed scatter of predicted mean values. These discrepancies might be attributed to significant unrecognized sources of uncertainty (USU) that limit the accuracy to which these physical quantities can be determined. The objective of our work has been to develop procedures for revealing and including USU estimates in nuclear data evaluations involving experimental input data. We conclude that the presence of USU may be revealed, and estimates of magnitudes made, through quantitative analyses. This paper identifies several specific clues that can be explored by evaluators in identifying the existence of USU. It then describes numerical procedures to generate quantitative estimates of USU magnitudes. Key requirements for these procedures to be viable are that sufficient numbers of data points be available, for statistical reasons, and that additional supporting information about the measurements be provided by the experimenters. Realistic examples are described to illustrate these procedures and demonstrate their outcomes as well as limitations.

In particular, we prove that the approximation capability of deep sigmoid nets is not worse than that of deep ReLU nets by showing that ReLU activation function can be well approximated by deep sigmoid nets with two hidden layers and finitely many free parameters but not vice-verse. We also establish the global convergence of the proposed ADMM for the nonlinearly constrained formulation of the deep sigmoid nets training from arbitrary initial points to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point at a rate of order ${\cal O}(1/k)$. Besides sigmoid activation, such a convergence theorem holds for a general class of smooth activations.

In many real-world applications, the agents can only acquire a partial view of the world. Here we consider a setting whereby most agents' observations are also extremely noisy, hence only weakly correlated to the true state of the environment. Under these circumstances, learning an optimal policy becomes particularly challenging, even in the unrealistic case that an agent's policy can be made conditional upon all other agents' observations. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm enhanced by a communication medium (MADDPG-M), which implements a two-level, concurrent learning mechanism. An agent's policy depends on its own private observations as well as those explicitly shared by others through a communication medium. At any given point in time, an agent must decide whether its private observations are sufficiently informative to be shared with others. However, our environments provide no explicit feedback informing an agent whether a communication action is beneficial, rather the communication policies must also be learned through experience concurrently to the main policies.

Deep kernel learning showed success in adopting a deep network for feature extraction followed by a GP used as function model. Recently,it was suggested that, albeit training with marginal likelihood, the deterministic nature of feature extractor might lead to overfitting while the replacement with a Bayesian network seemed to cure it. Here, we propose the conditional Deep Gaussian Process (DGP) in which the intermediate GPs in hierarchical composition are supported by the hyperdata and the exposed GP remains zero mean. Motivated by the inducing points in sparse GP, the hyperdata also play the role of function supports, but are hyperparameters rather than random variables. We follow our previous moment matching approach to approximate the marginal prior for conditional DGP with a GP carrying an effective kernel. Thus, as in empirical Bayes, the hyperdata are learned by optimizing the approximate marginal likelihood which implicitly depends on the hyperdata via the kernel. We shall show the equivalence with the deep kernel learning in the limit of dense hyperdata in latent space. However, the conditional DGP and the corresponding approximate inference enjoy the benefit of being more Bayesian than deep kernel learning. Preliminary extrapolation results demonstrate expressive power from the depth of hierarchy by exploiting the exact covariance and hyperdata learning, in comparison with GP kernel composition, DGP variational inference and deep kernel learning. We also address the non-Gaussian aspect of our model as well as way of upgrading to a full Bayes inference.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:30.278000

However, these beliefs have not been comprehensively verified, and growing evidence casts doubt on them. In this paper, we highlight the risks related to overreliance and susceptibility to adversarial manipulation of these so-called ""intrinsically (aka inherently) interpretable"" models by design. We introduce two strategies for adversarial analysis with prototype manipulation and backdoor attacks against prototype-based networks, and discuss how concept bottleneck models defend against these attacks. Fooling the model's reasoning by exploiting its use of latent prototypes manifests the inherent uninterpretability of deep neural networks, leading to a false sense of security reinforced by a visual confirmation bias. The reported limitations of part-prototype networks put their trustworthiness and applicability into question, motivating further work on the robustness and alignment of (deep) interpretable models.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:30.281000

Also, apart from algorithmic innovations, we account for more specific and powerful hardware (leading to higher FLOPS) that is usually accompanied with important energy efficiency optimisations. We also move the focus from the first implementation of a breakthrough paper towards the consolidated version of the techniques one or two year later. Under this distinctive and comprehensive perspective, we study relevant models in the areas of computer vision and natural language processing: for a sustained increase in performance we see a much softer growth in energy consumption than previously anticipated.

Communication then requires two agents labour under similar compulsions and have similar experiences (construct similar solutions to similar tasks). Any non-human intelligence may construct solutions such that any rationale for their behaviour (and thus the meaning of their signals) is outside the scope of what a human is inclined to notice or comprehend. Further, the more compressed a signal, the closer it will appear to random noise. Another intelligence may possess the ability to compress information to the extent that, to us, their signals would appear indistinguishable from noise (an explanation for The Fermi Paradox). To facilitate predictive accuracy an AGI would tend to more compressed representations of the world, making any rationale for their behaviour more difficult to comprehend for the same reason.

Bennett, Kris Hauser",2013,"In the modern healthcare system, rapidly expanding costs/complexity, the growing myriad of treatment options, and exploding information streams that often do not effectively reach the front lines hinder the ability to choose optimal treatment decisions over time. The goal in this paper is to develop a general purpose (non-disease-specific) computational/artificial intelligence (AI) framework to address these challenges. This serves two potential functions: 1) a simulation environment for exploring various healthcare policies, payment methodologies, etc., and 2) the basis for clinical artificial intelligence - an AI that can think like a doctor. This approach combines Markov decision processes and dynamic decision networks to learn from clinical data and develop complex plans via simulation of alternative sequential decision paths while capturing the sometimes conflicting, sometimes synergistic interactions of various components in the healthcare system. It can operate in partially observable environments (in the case of missing observations or data) by maintaining belief states about patient health status and functions as an online agent that plans and re-plans. This framework was evaluated using real patient data from an electronic health record. Such an AI framework easily outperforms the current treatment-as-usual (TAU) case-rate/fee-for-service models of healthcare (Cost per Unit Change: $189 vs. $497) while obtaining a 30-35% increase in patient outcomes. Tweaking certain model parameters further enhances this advantage, obtaining roughly 50% more improvement for roughly half the costs. Given careful design and problem formulation, an AI simulation framework can approximate optimal decisions even in complex and uncertain environments.

This framework combines temporal and epistemic modalities with a notion of plausibility, allowing us to examine the change of beliefs over time. In this paper, we show how belief revision and belief update can be captured in our framework. This allows us to compare the assumptions made by each method, and to better understand the principles underlying them. In particular, it shows that Katsuno and Mendelzon's notion of belief update (Katsuno & Mendelzon, 1991a) depends on several strong assumptions that may limit its applicability in artificial intelligence.

Aside from the commonalities of both approaches, a significant difference can be observed by looking at the results. While conceptual models are comprehensible, reproducible, and explicit knowledge representations, AI techniques are capable of efficiently deriving an output from a given input while acting as a black box. AI solutions often lack comprehensiveness and reproducibility. Even the developers of AI systems can't explain why a certain output is derived. In the Conceptual Modeling meets Artificial Intelligence (CMAI) workshop, we are interested in tackling the intersection of the two, thus far, mostly isolated approached disciplines of CM and AI. The workshop embraces the assumption, that manifold mutual benefits can be realized by i) investigating what Conceptual Modeling (CM) can contribute to AI, and ii) the other way around, what Artificial Intelligence (AI) can contribute to CM.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:31.841000

By exploiting a large number of individuals, it is often possible to produce effects that go far beyond the capabilities of the smartest individuals, or even to produce intelligent collective behaviour out of not-so-intelligent individuals. Indeed, collective intelligence, namely the capability of a group to act collectively in a seemingly intelligent way, is increasingly often a design goal of engineered computational systems--motivated by recent techno-scientific trends like the Internet of Things, swarm robotics, and crowd computing, just to name a few. For several years, the collective intelligence observed in natural and artificial systems has served as a source of inspiration for engineering ideas, models, and mechanisms. Today, artificial and computational collective intelligence are recognised research topics, spanning various techniques, kinds of target systems, and application domains. However, there is still a lot of fragmentation in the research panorama of the topic within computer science, and the verticality of most communities and contributions makes it difficult to extract the core underlying ideas and frames of reference. The challenge is to identify, place in a common structure, and ultimately connect the different areas and methods addressing intelligent collectives. To address this gap, this paper considers a set of broad scoping questions providing a map of collective intelligence research, mostly by the point of view of computer scientists and engineers. Accordingly, it covers preliminary notions, fundamental concepts, and the main research perspectives, identifying opportunities and challenges for researchers on artificial and computational collective intelligence engineering.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:31.846000

However, current efforts have, at most, only addressed the first two problem dimensions concurrently and do not account for the propagative effects that uncertain scheduling outcomes in one dimension can have on another dimension. In addition, existing approaches for airline disruption management include human specialists who decide on necessary corrective actions for airline schedule disruptions on the day of operation. However, human specialists are limited in their ability to process copious amounts of information imperative for making robust decisions that simultaneously address all problem dimensions during disruption management. Therefore, there is a need to augment the decision-making capabilities of a human specialist with quantitative and qualitative tools that can rationalize complex interactions amongst all dimensions in airline disruption management, and provide objective insights to the specialists in the airline operations control center. To that effect, we provide a discussion and demonstration of an agnostic and systematic paradigm for enabling expeditious simultaneously-integrated recovery of all problem dimensions during airline disruption management, through an intelligent multi-agent system that employs principles from artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. Results indicate that our paradigm for simultaneously-integrated recovery executes in polynomial time and is effective when all the flights in the airline route network are disrupted.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:31.848000

No framework exists in AI that allows this kind of methodical manipulation: Performance results on the few tasks in current use (cf. board games, question-answering) cannot be easily compared, however similar or different. The issue is even more acute with respect to artificial *general* intelligence systems, which must handle unanticipated tasks whose specifics cannot be known beforehand. A *task theory* would enable addressing tasks at the *class* level, bypassing their specifics, providing the appropriate formalization and classification of tasks, environments, and their parameters, resulting in more rigorous ways of measuring, comparing, and evaluating intelligent behavior.

They produce robust results with a high level of accuracy. However, most of these techniques do not provide human-understandable explanations for supporting their results and decisions. They usually act as black boxes, and it is not easy to understand how decisions have been made. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which has received much interest recently, tries to provide human-understandable explanations for decision-making and trained AI models. For instance, in digital agriculture, related domains often present peculiar or input features with no link to background knowledge. The application of the data mining process on agricultural data leads to results (knowledge), which are difficult to explain. In this paper, we propose a knowledge map model and an ontology design as an XAI framework (OAK4XAI) to deal with this issue. The framework does not only consider the data analysis part of the process, but it takes into account the semantics aspect of the domain knowledge via an ontology and a knowledge map model, provided as modules of the framework. Many ongoing XAI studies aim to provide accurate and verbalizable accounts for how given feature values contribute to model decisions. The proposed approach, however, focuses on providing consistent information and definitions of concepts, algorithms, and values involved in the data mining models.

  The mathematical techniques underlying both these areas have more in common than is sometimes realized. Vector spaces took a position at the axiomatic heart of quantum mechanics in the 1930s, and this adoption was a key motivation for the derivation of logic and probability from the linear geometry of vector spaces. Quantum interactions between particles are modelled using the tensor product, which is also used to express objects and operations in artificial neural networks.
  This paper describes some of these common mathematical areas, including examples of how they are used in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in automated reasoning and natural language processing (NLP). Techniques discussed include vector spaces, scalar products, subspaces and implication, orthogonal projection and negation, dual vectors, density matrices, positive operators, and tensor products. Application areas include information retrieval, categorization and implication, modelling word-senses and disambiguation, inference in knowledge bases, and semantic composition.
  Some of these approaches can potentially be implemented on quantum hardware. Many of the practical steps in this implementation are in early stages, and some are already realized.

In a series of papers culminating in book (Hutter, 2005), an exciting sound and complete mathematical model for a super intelligent agent (AIXI) has been developed and rigorously analyzed. While nowadays most AI researchers avoid discussing intelligence, the award-winning PhD thesis (Legg, 2008) provided the philosophical embedding and investigated the UAI-based universal measure of rational intelligence, which is formal, objective and non-anthropocentric. Recently, effective approximations of AIXI have been derived and experimentally investigated in JAIR paper (Veness et al. 2011). This practical breakthrough has resulted in some impressive applications, finally muting earlier critique that UAI is only a theory.

For instance, AIXI is able to learn from scratch to play TicTacToe, Pacman, Kuhn Poker, and other games by trial and error, without even providing the rules of the games.
  These achievements give new hope that the grand goal of Artificial General Intelligence is not elusive.
  This article provides an informal overview of UAI in context. It attempts to gently introduce a very theoretical, formal, and mathematical subject, and discusses philosophical and technical ingredients, traits of intelligence, some social questions, and the past and future of UAI.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:31.900000

Melanie Mitchell argues the debate will only be settled through long term, scientific investigation. To that end here is a short, accessible and provocative overview of AGI. I compare definitions of intelligence, settling on intelligence in terms of adaptation and AGI as an artificial scientist. Taking my cue from Sutton's Bitter Lesson I describe two foundational tools used to build adaptive systems: search and approximation. I compare pros, cons, hybrids and architectures like o3, AlphaGo, AERA, NARS and Hyperon. I then discuss overall meta-approaches to making systems behave more intelligently. I divide them into scale-maxing, simp-maxing, w-maxing based on the Bitter Lesson, Ockham's and Bennett's Razors. These maximise resources, simplicity of form, and the weakness of constraints on functionality. I discuss examples including AIXI, the free energy principle and The Embiggening of language models. I conclude that though scale-maxed approximation dominates, AGI will be a fusion of tools and meta-approaches. The Embiggening was enabled by improvements in hardware.

We additionally cross-compared Bayesian and free-energy approaches, as they are widely applied to modeling psychiatric disorders and share basic mechanisms with neural networks. Models of schizophrenia mainly focused on hallucinations and delusional thoughts using neural dysconnections or inhibitory imbalance as the predominating alteration. Models of autism rather focused on perceptual difficulties, mainly excessive attention to environment details, implemented as excessive inhibitory connections or increased sensory precision. We found an excessive tight view of the psychopathologies around one specific and simplified effect, usually constrained to the technical idiosyncrasy of the used network architecture. Recent theories and evidence on sensorimotor integration and body perception combined with modern neural network architectures could offer a broader and novel spectrum to approach these psychopathologies.

In the case of regression tasks, prediction intervals (PIs) should be provided along with the deterministic predictions of deep learning models. Such PIs are useful or ""high-quality"" as long as they are sufficiently narrow and capture most of the probability density. In this paper, we present a method to learn prediction intervals for regression-based neural networks automatically in addition to the conventional target predictions. In particular, we train two companion neural networks: one that uses one output, the target estimate, and another that uses two outputs, the upper and lower bounds of the corresponding PI. Our main contribution is the design of a novel loss function for the PI-generation network that takes into account the output of the target-estimation network and has two optimization objectives: minimizing the mean prediction interval width and ensuring the PI integrity using constraints that maximize the prediction interval probability coverage implicitly. Furthermore, we introduce a self-adaptive coefficient that balances both objectives within the loss function, which alleviates the task of fine-tuning. Experiments using a synthetic dataset, eight benchmark datasets, and a real-world crop yield prediction dataset showed that our method was able to maintain a nominal probability coverage and produce significantly narrower PIs without detriment to its target estimation accuracy when compared to those PIs generated by three state-of-the-art neural-network-based methods.

However, most supervised SNN training methods, such as conversion from artificial neural networks or direct training with surrogate gradients, require complex computation rather than spike-based operations of spiking neurons during training. In this paper, we study spike-based implicit differentiation on the equilibrium state (SPIDE) that extends the recently proposed training method, implicit differentiation on the equilibrium state (IDE), for supervised learning with purely spike-based computation, which demonstrates the potential for energy-efficient training of SNNs. Specifically, we introduce ternary spiking neuron couples and prove that implicit differentiation can be solved by spikes based on this design, so the whole training procedure, including both forward and backward passes, is made as event-driven spike computation, and weights are updated locally with two-stage average firing rates. Then we propose to modify the reset membrane potential to reduce the approximation error of spikes. With these key components, we can train SNNs with flexible structures in a small number of time steps and with firing sparsity during training, and the theoretical estimation of energy costs demonstrates the potential for high efficiency.

The empirical observations confirm the theoretical hypothesis regarding the nature of neural network attraction basins. Entropic loss is shown to exhibit stronger gradients and fewer stationary points than quadratic loss, indicating that entropic loss has a more searchable landscape. Quadratic loss is shown to be more resilient to overfitting than entropic loss. Both losses are shown to exhibit local minima, but the number of local minima is shown to decrease with an increase in dimensionality.

Deep neural networks trained with a conventional method are prone to over-confident predictions.

Properties of the new cost function are derived to indicate how improved uncertainty estimation is achieved.

However, with more bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to the point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on the insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra bits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit allocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise allocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and accuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and the bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable through gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths and temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle different temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal lengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically formulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may incur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size renewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets, including the static CIFAR and ImageNet datasets and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS and DVS-GESTURE datasets, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and computation cost while achieving higher accuracy. Particularly, our SEWResNet-34 can achieve a 2.69\% accuracy gain and 4.16$\times$ lower bit budgets over the advanced baseline work on ImageNet.

Popular methods for MDI use global statistics computed from the entire data set (e.g., the feature-wise medians), or build predictive models operating independently on every instance. In this paper we propose a more general framework for MDI, leveraging recent work in the field of graph neural networks (GNNs). We formulate the MDI task in terms of a graph denoising autoencoder, where each edge of the graph encodes the similarity between two patterns. A GNN encoder learns to build intermediate representations for each example by interleaving classical projection layers and locally combining information between neighbors, while another decoding GNN learns to reconstruct the full imputed data set from this intermediate embedding. In order to speed-up training and improve the performance, we use a combination of multiple losses, including an adversarial loss implemented with the Wasserstein metric and a gradient penalty. We also explore a few extensions to the basic architecture involving the use of residual connections between layers, and of global statistics computed from the data set to improve the accuracy. On a large experimental evaluation, we show that our method robustly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for MDI, especially for large percentages of missing values.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:34.967000

It has recently been demonstrated that combining Hebbian learning with occasional alterations of normal neural states avoids this problem by means of self-organized enlargement of the best basins of attraction. However, so far it is not clear to what extent this process of self-optimization is also operative in real brains. Here we demonstrate that it can be transferred to more biologically plausible neural networks by implementing a self-optimizing spiking neural network model. In addition, by using this spiking neural network to emulate a Hopfield network with Hebbian learning, we attempt to make a connection between rate-based and temporal coding based neural systems. Although further work is required to make this model more realistic, it already suggests that the efficacy of the self-optimizing process is independent from the simplifying assumptions of a conventional Hopfield network.

McGuire, Henrik Bohr, John W. Clark, Robert Haschke, Chris Pershing, Johann Rafelski",2002,"  We study the diversity of complex spatio-temporal patterns in the behavior of random synchronous asymmetric neural networks (RSANNs). Special attention is given to the impact of disordered threshold values on limit-cycle diversity and limit-cycle complexity in RSANNs which have `normal' thresholds by default. Surprisingly, RSANNs exhibit only a small repertoire of rather complex limit-cycle patterns when all parameters are fixed. This repertoire of complex patterns is also rather stable with respect to small parameter changes. These two unexpected results may generalize to the study of other complex systems. In order to reach beyond this seemingly-disabling `stable and small' aspect of the limit-cycle repertoire of RSANNs, we have found that if an RSANN has threshold disorder above a critical level, then there is a rapid increase of the size of the repertoire of patterns. The repertoire size initially follows a power-law function of the magnitude of the threshold disorder. As the disorder increases further, the limit-cycle patterns themselves become simpler until at a second critical level most of the limit cycles become simple fixed points. Nonetheless, for moderate changes in the threshold parameters, RSANNs are found to display specific features of behavior desired for rapidly-responding processing systems: accessibility to a large set of complex patterns.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:34.973000

At the core of our algorithm, we use the polynomial-time outlier-filtering procedure for robust mean estimation proposed by Steinhardt et al. (ITCS 2018) to filter-out corrupt gradients. In order to be able to apply their filtering procedure in our {\em heterogeneous} data setting where workers compute {\em stochastic} gradients, we derive a new matrix concentration result, which may be of independent interest.
  We provide convergence analyses for smooth strongly-convex and non-convex objectives. We derive our results under the bounded variance assumption on local stochastic gradients and a {\em deterministic} condition on datasets, namely, gradient dissimilarity; and for both these quantities, we provide concrete bounds in the statistical heterogeneous data model. We give a trade-off between the mini-batch size for stochastic gradients and the approximation error. Our algorithm can tolerate up to $\frac{1}{4}$ fraction Byzantine workers. It can find approximate optimal parameters in the strongly-convex setting exponentially fast and reach to an approximate stationary point in the non-convex setting with a linear speed, thus, matching the convergence rates of vanilla SGD in the Byzantine-free setting.
  We also propose and analyze a Byzantine-resilient SGD algorithm with gradient compression, where workers send $k$ random coordinates of their gradients.

Behavioral finance data, a subset of FBD, is seeing exponential growth and this presents an unprecedented opportunity to study behavioral finance employing big data analytics methodologies. The present study maps machine learning (ML) techniques and behavioral finance categories to explore the potential for using ML techniques to address behavioral aspects in FBD. The ontological feasibility of such an approach is presented and the primary purpose of this study is propositioned- ML based behavioral models can effectively estimate performance in FBD. A simple machine learning algorithm is successfully employed to study behavioral performance in an artificial stock market to validate the propositions.

However, current generative data augmentation frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction. Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in both full-data and few-shot scenarios.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:46.226000

Recent advancements in sensor networks and the widespread adoption of IoT have led to the collection of physical-sensor data on an enormous scale. However, significant challenges arise in high-quality big data analytics. To uncover big data challenges and enhance data quality, it is essential to quantitatively unveil data characteristics. Furthermore, the existing studies lack analysis of the specific time-related characteristics. Enhancing the efficiency and precision of data analytics through the big data lifecycle requires a comprehensive understanding of data characteristics to address the hidden big data challenges. To fill in the research gap, this paper proposes a systematic data characteristic framework based on a 6Vs model. The framework aims to unveil the data characteristics in terms of data volume, variety, velocity, veracity, value, and variability through a set of statistical indicators. This model improves the objectivity of data characteristic understanding by relying solely on data-driven indicators. The indicators related to time-related characteristics in physical-sensor data are also included. Furthermore, the big data challenges are linked to each dimension of the 6Vs model to gain a quantitative understanding of the data challenges. Finally, a pipeline is developed to implement the proposed framework, and two case studies are conducted to illustrate the process of understanding the physical-sensor data characteristics and making recommendations for data preprocessing to address the big data challenges.

Shifting the scope of data from small-size, structured, and stable data to huge volume, unstructured, and quickly changing data brings many data management challenges. Different tools cope with these challenges in their own way due to their architectural limitations. There are numerous parameters to take into consideration when choosing the right data management framework based on the task at hand. In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark for two widely used Big Data analytics tools, namely Apache Spark and Hadoop MapReduce, on a common data mining task, i.e., classification.

These metrics are specialized to measure the performance for classification task. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous study in the literature that employs all these metrics while taking into consideration task-specific concerns. We show that Spark is 5 times faster than MapReduce on training the model. Nevertheless, the performance of Spark degrades when the input workload gets larger. Scaling the environment by additional clusters significantly improves the performance of Spark. However, similar enhancement is not observed in Hadoop.

Cache managers directly impact the overall performance of computer systems. They govern decisions about which objects should be cached, the duration they should be cached for, and decides on which objects to evict from the cache if it is full. These three decisions impact both the cache hit rate and size of the storage that is needed to achieve that cache hit rate. An optimal cache manager will avoid unnecessary operations, maximise the cache hit rate which results in fewer round trips to a slower backend storage system, and minimise the size of storage needed to achieve a high hit-rate.
  This project investigates using reinforcement learning in cache management by designing three separate agents for each of the cache manager tasks. Furthermore, the project investigates two advanced reinforcement learning architectures for multi-decision problems: a single multi-task agent and a multi-agent. We also introduce a framework to simplify the modelling of computer systems problems as a reinforcement learning task. The framework abstracts delayed experiences observations and reward assignment in computer systems while providing a flexible way to scale to multiple agents.
  Simulation results based on an established database benchmark system show that reinforcement learning agents can achieve a higher cache hit rate over heuristic driven algorithms while minimising the needed space. They are also able to adapt to a changing workload and dynamically adjust their caching strategy accordingly. The proposed cache manager model is generic and applicable to other types of caches, such as file system caches. This project is the first, to our knowledge, to model cache manager decisions as a multi-task control problem.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:47.134000

For instance, consider a student preparing for a series of tests. She would typically take a few practice tests to know which areas she needs to improve upon. Based of the scores she obtains in these practice tests, she would formulate a strategy for maximizing her scores in the actual tests. We treat this scenario in the context of an agent exploring a fixed-horizon episodic Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the agent can practice on the MDP for some number of episodes (not necessarily known in advance) before starting to incur regret for its actions.
  During practice, the agent's goal must be to maximize the probability of following an optimal policy. This is akin to the problem of Pure Exploration (PE). We extend the PE problem of Multi Armed Bandits (MAB) to MDPs and propose a Bayesian algorithm called Posterior Sampling for Pure Exploration (PSPE), which is similar to its bandit counterpart. We show that the Bayesian simple regret converges at an optimal exponential rate when using PSPE.
  When the agent starts being evaluated, its goal would be to minimize the cumulative regret incurred. This is akin to the problem of Reinforcement Learning (RL). The agent uses the Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning algorithm (PSRL) initialized with the posteriors of the practice phase. We hypothesize that this PSPE + PSRL combination is an optimal strategy for minimizing regret in RL problems with an initial practice phase.

We can alleviate this using weak supervision: a framework that uses expert-defined rules $\boldsymbolλ$ to estimate probabilistic labels $p(y|\boldsymbolλ)$ for the entire data set. These rules, however, are dependent on what experts know about the problem, and hence may be inaccurate or may fail to capture important parts of the problem-space. To mitigate this, we propose Active WeaSuL: an approach that incorporates active learning into weak supervision. In Active WeaSuL, experts do not only define rules, but they also iteratively provide the true label for a small set of points where the weak supervision model is most likely to be mistaken, which are then used to better estimate the probabilistic labels. In this way, the weak labels provide a warm start, which active learning then improves upon. We make two contributions: 1) a modification of the weak supervision loss function, such that the expert-labelled data inform and improve the combination of weak labels; and 2) the maxKL divergence sampling strategy, which determines for which data points expert labelling is most beneficial. Our experiments show that when the budget for labelling data is limited (e.g. $\leq 60$ data points), Active WeaSuL outperforms weak supervision, active learning, and competing strategies, with only a handful of labelled data points.

First, under sufficiently small pretraining budgets, supervised pretraining on ImageNet consistently outperforms a comparable contrastive model on eight diverse image classification datasets. This suggests that the common practice of comparing pretraining approaches at hundreds or thousands of epochs may not produce actionable insights for those with more limited compute budgets. Second, even with larger pretraining budgets we identify tasks where supervised learning prevails, perhaps because the object-centric bias of supervised pretraining makes the model more resilient to common corruptions and spurious foreground-background correlations.

Mainstream SSL image classification methods mostly optimize a loss that additively combines a supervised classification objective with a regularization term derived solely from unlabeled data. This formulation neglects the potential for interaction between labeled and unlabeled images. In this paper, we introduce InterLUDE, a new approach to enhance SSL made of two parts that each benefit from labeled-unlabeled interaction. The first part, embedding fusion, interpolates between labeled and unlabeled embeddings to improve representation learning. The second part is a new loss, grounded in the principle of consistency regularization, that aims to minimize discrepancies in the model's predictions between labeled versus unlabeled inputs. Experiments on standard closed-set SSL benchmarks and a medical SSL task with an uncurated unlabeled set show clear benefits to our approach.

In this work, we challenge the long-standing success of consistency regularization by introducing self-supervised regularization as the basis for combining semantic feature representations from unlabeled data.

In particular, self-supervised learning (SSL) of utterance-level speech representation can be used in speech applications that require discriminative representation of consistent attributes within an utterance: speaker, language, emotion, and age. Existing frame-level self-supervised speech representation, e.g., wav2vec, can be used as utterance-level representation with pooling, but the models are usually large. There are also SSL techniques to learn utterance-level representation. One of the most successful is a contrastive method, which requires negative sampling: selecting alternative samples to contrast with the current sample (anchor). However, this does not ensure that all the negative samples belong to classes different from the anchor class without labels. This paper applies a non-contrastive self-supervised method to learn utterance-level embeddings. We adapted DIstillation with NO labels (DINO) from computer vision to speech. Unlike contrastive methods, DINO does not require negative sampling. We compared DINO to x-vector trained in a supervised manner. When transferred to down-stream tasks (speaker verification, speech emotion recognition (SER), and Alzheimer's disease detection), DINO outperformed x-vector. We studied the influence of several aspects during transfer learning such as dividing the fine-tuning process into steps, chunk lengths, or augmentation. During fine-tuning, tuning the last affine layers first and then the whole network surpassed fine-tuning all at once. Using shorter chunk lengths, although they generate more diverse inputs, did not necessarily improve performance, implying speech segments at least with a specific length are required for better performance per application.

The problem of minimizing the cost associated with collecting labeled observations has gained a lot of attention in recent years, particularly in real-world applications where data is only available in an unlabeled form. Annotating each observation can be time-consuming and costly, making it difficult to obtain large amounts of labeled data. To overcome this issue, many active learning strategies have been proposed in the last decades, aiming to select the most informative observations for labeling in order to improve the performance of machine learning models. These approaches can be broadly divided into two categories: static pool-based and stream-based active learning. Pool-based active learning involves selecting a subset of observations from a closed pool of unlabeled data, and it has been the focus of many surveys and literature reviews. However, the growing availability of data streams has led to an increase in the number of approaches that focus on online active learning, which involves continuously selecting and labeling observations as they arrive in a stream.

We apply a contrastive learning framework on multi-band galaxy photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to learn image representations. We then use them for galaxy morphology classification, and fine-tune them for photometric redshift estimation, using labels from the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset and SDSS spectroscopy.

Thus, it is unknown whether common augmentation strategies employed in Siamese representation learning generalize to medical images and to what extent. To address this challenge, in this study, we systematically assess the effect of various augmentations on the quality and robustness of the learned representations. We train and evaluate Siamese Networks for abnormality detection on chest X-Rays across three large datasets (MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert and VinDR-CXR). We investigate the efficacy of the learned representations through experiments involving linear probing, fine-tuning, zero-shot transfer, and data efficiency. Finally, we identify a set of augmentations that yield robust representations that generalize well to both out-of-distribution data and diseases, while outperforming supervised baselines using just zero-shot transfer and linear probes by up to 20%.

By learning to remain invariant to applied data augmentations, methods such as SimCLR and MoCo can reach quality on par with supervised approaches. However, this invariance may be detrimental for solving downstream tasks that depend on traits affected by augmentations used during pretraining, such as color. In this paper, we propose to foster sensitivity to such characteristics in the representation space by modifying the projector network, a common component of self-supervised architectures. Specifically, we supplement the projector with information about augmentations applied to images. For the projector to take advantage of this auxiliary conditioning when solving the SSL task, the feature extractor learns to preserve the augmentation information in its representations. Our approach, coined Conditional Augmentation-aware Self-supervised Learning (CASSLE), is directly applicable to typical joint-embedding SSL methods regardless of their objective functions. Moreover, it does not require major changes in the network architecture or prior knowledge of downstream tasks.

This technical manuscript summarises and extends the idea of systematically rephrasing supervised quantum models as a kernel method. With this, a lot of near-term and fault-tolerant quantum models can be replaced by a general support vector machine whose kernel computes distances between data-encoding quantum states. Kernel-based training is then guaranteed to find better or equally good quantum models than variational circuit training.

However, the success of such algorithms has been dependent on availability of large datasets. Moreover, due to their black box nature, it is challenging to analyze how such algorithms work, which may be crucial in applications where failure is very costly.

Our algorithms output a bang-bang (binary) control input by taking in feedback of the state of the dynamical system. The algorithms learn this control input by maximizing a reward function in both short and long time horizons.

Most QAS algorithms tightly couple the search space and search algorithm, typically requiring the evaluation of numerous quantum circuits, resulting in high computational costs and limiting scalability to larger quantum circuits. Predictor-based QAS algorithms mitigate this issue by estimating circuit performance based on structure or embedding. However, these methods often demand time-intensive labeling to optimize gate parameters across many circuits, which is crucial for training accurate predictors. Inspired by the classical neural architecture search algorithm Arch2vec, we investigate the potential of unsupervised representation learning for QAS without relying on predictors. Our framework decouples unsupervised architecture representation learning from the search process, enabling the learned representations to be applied across various downstream tasks. Additionally, it integrates an improved quantum circuit graph encoding scheme, addressing the limitations of existing representations and enhancing search efficiency. This predictor-free approach removes the need for large labeled datasets. During the search, we employ REINFORCE and Bayesian Optimization to explore the latent representation space and compare their performance against baseline methods.

This permutation symmetry plays an important role in understanding the computation performance of a broad class of neural networks with two or more hidden units. However, a theoretical study of the permutation symmetry is still lacking. Here, we propose a minimal model with only two hidden units in a restricted Boltzmann machine, which aims to address how the permutation symmetry affects the critical learning data size at which the concept-formation (or spontaneous symmetry breaking in physics language) starts, and moreover semi-rigorously prove a conjecture that the critical data size is independent of the number of hidden units once this number is finite. Remarkably, we find that the embedded correlation between two receptive fields of hidden units reduces the critical data size. In particular, the weakly-correlated receptive fields have the benefit of significantly reducing the minimal data size that triggers the transition, given less noisy data. Inspired by the theory, we also propose an efficient fully-distributed algorithm to infer the receptive fields of hidden units. Furthermore, our minimal model reveals that the permutation symmetry can also be spontaneously broken following the spontaneous symmetry breaking. Overall, our results demonstrate that the unsupervised learning is a progressive combination of spontaneous symmetry breaking and permutation symmetry breaking which are both spontaneous processes driven by data streams (observations).

Most generative models rely on 2D kernels to generate images and make few assumptions about the 3D world. These models therefore tend to create blurry images or artefacts in tasks that require a strong 3D understanding, such as novel-view synthesis. HoloGAN instead learns a 3D representation of the world, and to render this representation in a realistic manner. Unlike other GANs, HoloGAN provides explicit control over the pose of generated objects through rigid-body transformations of the learnt 3D features. Our experiments show that using explicit 3D features enables HoloGAN to disentangle 3D pose and identity, which is further decomposed into shape and appearance, while still being able to generate images with similar or higher visual quality than other generative models. HoloGAN can be trained end-to-end from unlabelled 2D images only. Particularly, we do not require pose labels, 3D shapes, or multiple views of the same objects. This shows that HoloGAN is the first generative model that learns 3D representations from natural images in an entirely unsupervised manner.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:47.721000

The methods can typically be categorized into supervised learning methods and unsupervised or model-based learning methods. Supervised learning methods have recently shown success in image restoration tasks. However, they often rely on large training sets. Model-based learning methods such as dictionary or transform learning do not require large or paired training sets and often have good generalization properties, since they learn general properties of CT image sets. Recent works have shown the promising reconstruction performance of methods such as PWLS-ULTRA that rely on clustering the underlying (reconstructed) image patches into a learned union of transforms. In this paper, we propose a new Supervised-UnsuPERvised (SUPER) reconstruction framework for LDCT image reconstruction that combines the benefits of supervised learning methods and (unsupervised) transform learning-based methods such as PWLS-ULTRA that involve highly image-adaptive clustering. The SUPER model consists of several layers, each of which includes a deep network learned in a supervised manner and an unsupervised iterative method that involves image-adaptive components. The SUPER reconstruction algorithms are learned in a greedy manner from training data.

In this paper, we establish a unified framework of using unsupervised deep learning to solve both kinds of problems with both instantaneous and statistic constraints. For a constrained variable optimization, we first convert it into an equivalent functional optimization problem with instantaneous constraints. Then, to ensure the instantaneous constraints in the functional optimization problems, we use DNN to approximate the Lagrange multiplier functions, which is trained together with a DNN to approximate the policy. We take two resource allocation problems in ultra-reliable and low-latency communications as examples to illustrate how to guarantee the complex and stringent quality-of-service (QoS) constraints with the framework.

The motivation of our unsupervised learning is that a robust tracker should be effective in bidirectional tracking. Specifically, the tracker is able to forward localize a target object in successive frames and backtrace to its initial position in the first frame. Based on such a motivation, in the training process, we measure the consistency between forward and backward trajectories to learn a robust tracker from scratch merely using unlabeled videos. We build our framework on a Siamese correlation filter network, and propose a multi-frame validation scheme and a cost-sensitive loss to facilitate unsupervised learning.

Similarly to previous methods, our approach is fully unsupervised in a sense that it does not require or make any use of annotated landmarks for the target object category. Contrary to previous works, we do however assume that a landmark detector, which has already learned a structured representation for a given object category in a fully supervised manner, is available. Under this setting, our main idea boils down to adapting the given pre-trained network to the target object categories in a fully unsupervised manner. To this end, our method uses the pre-trained network as a core which remains frozen and does not get updated during training, and learns, in an unsupervised manner, only a projection matrix to perform the adaptation to the target categories. By building upon an existing structured representation learned in a supervised manner, the optimization problem solved by our method is much more constrained with significantly less parameters to learn which seems to be important for the case of unsupervised learning.

Then, we train over $14000$ models covering most prominent methods and evaluation metrics in a reproducible large-scale experimental study on eight data sets. We observe that while the different methods successfully enforce properties ""encouraged"" by the corresponding losses, well-disentangled models seemingly cannot be identified without supervision. Furthermore, different evaluation metrics do not always agree on what should be considered ""disentangled"" and exhibit systematic differences in the estimation. Finally, increased disentanglement does not seem to necessarily lead to a decreased sample complexity of learning for downstream tasks.

This allows to reconstruct past foehn probabilities based solely on reanalysis data. Applying this method to ERA5 reanalysis data for six stations across Switzerland and Austria achieves accurate hourly reconstructions of north and south foehn occurrence, respectively, dating back to 1940.

Continual learning is aimed towards addressing this challenge. However, there is a gap between existing supervised continual learning and human-like intelligence, where human is able to learn from both labeled and unlabeled data. How unlabeled data affects learning and catastrophic forgetting in the continual learning process remains unknown. To explore these issues, we formulate a new semi-supervised continual learning method, which can be generically applied to existing continual learning models. Specifically, a novel gradient learner learns from labeled data to predict gradients on unlabeled data. Hence, the unlabeled data could fit into the supervised continual learning method. Different from conventional semi-supervised settings, we do not hypothesize that the underlying classes, which are associated to the unlabeled data, are known to the learning process.

However, there is a scarcity of labeled data in current RSIOD datasets, which significantly limits the performance of current detection algorithms. Although existing techniques, e.g., data augmentation and semi-supervised learning, can mitigate this scarcity issue to some extent, they are heavily dependent on high-quality labeled data and perform worse in rare object classes. To address this issue, this paper proposes a layout-controllable diffusion generative model (i.e. AeroGen) tailored for RSIOD. To our knowledge, AeroGen is the first model to simultaneously support horizontal and rotated bounding box condition generation, thus enabling the generation of high-quality synthetic images that meet specific layout and object category requirements. Additionally, we propose an end-to-end data augmentation framework that integrates a diversity-conditioned generator and a filtering mechanism to enhance both the diversity and quality of generated data. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthetic data produced by our method are of high quality and diversity. Furthermore, the synthetic RSIOD data can significantly improve the detection performance of existing RSIOD models, i.e., the mAP metrics on DIOR, DIOR-R, and HRSC datasets are improved by 3.7%, 4.3%, and 2.43%, respectively.

However, epidemic outbreaks are never captured in statistical data alone but are communicated by narratives, supported by empirical observations. Outbreak reports discuss correlations between populations, locations and the disease to infer insights into causes, vectors and potential interventions. The problem with these narratives is usually the lack of consistent structure or strong conventions, which prohibit their formal analysis in larger corpora. Our interdisciplinary research investigates more than 100 reports from the third plague pandemic (1894-1952) evaluating ways of building a corpus to extract and structure this narrative information through text mining and manual annotation. In this paper we discuss the progress of our ongoing exploratory project, how we enhance optical character recognition (OCR) methods to improve text capture, our approach to structure the narratives and identify relevant entities in the reports. The structured corpus is made available via Solr enabling search and analysis across the whole collection for future research dedicated, for example, to the identification of concepts.

The inability of most automated data mining techniques to be generalized to all types of data is inherently related with their dependency on those types which deems them ineffective against anything slightly different. Meta-heuristics are algorithms which attempt to optimize some solution independently of the type of data used, whilst classifiers or neural networks focus on feature extrapolation and dimensionality reduction to fit some model onto data arranged in a particular way. These two algorithmic fields encompass a group of characteristics which when combined are seemingly capable of achieving data mining regardless of how it is arranged. To this end, this work proposes a means of combining meta-heuristic methods with conventional classifiers and neural networks in order to perform automated data mining. Experiments on the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit recognition were performed and it was empirically observed that using a ground truth labeled dataset's validation accuracy is inadequate for correcting labels of other previously unseen data instances.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:48.439000

Historical examples of data mining in astronomy are reviewed, followed by a discussion of one of the largest data-producing projects anticipated for the coming decade: the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). To facilitate data-driven discoveries in astronomy, we envision a new data-oriented research paradigm for astronomy and astrophysics -- astroinformatics. Astroinformatics is described as both a research approach and an educational imperative for modern data-intensive astronomy. An important application area for large time-domain sky surveys (such as LSST) is the rapid identification, characterization, and classification of real-time sky events (including moving objects, photometrically variable objects, and the appearance of transients). We describe one possible implementation of a classification broker for such events, which incorporates several astroinformatics techniques: user annotation, semantic tagging, metadata markup, heterogeneous data integration, and distributed data mining.

Deep Learning (DL) models have demonstrated accuracy in reproducing the features of the selected processes. However, current DL generative models are limited in their ability to adapt the learned distributions to generate data samples based on specific conditions or attributes. This limitation is particularly significant because the ability to control the type of generated data can be beneficial in various contexts, enabling a focus on specific behaviours, exploration of infrequent patterns, or simulation of alternative 'what-if' scenarios. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a conditional model for process data generation based on a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE). Conditional models offer control over the generation process by tuning input conditional variables, enabling more targeted and controlled data generation. Unlike other domains, CVAE for process mining faces specific challenges due to the multiperspective nature of the data and the need to adhere to control-flow rules while ensuring data variability. Specifically, we focus on generating process executions conditioned on control flow and temporal features of the trace, allowing us to produce traces for specific, identified sub-processes. The generated traces are then evaluated using common metrics for generative model assessment, along with additional metrics to evaluate the quality of the conditional generation",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:48.458000

An important task in temporal graph analysis is mining dense structures, i.e., identifying high-density subgraphs together with the span in which this high density is observed. In this paper, we introduce the concept of $(k, Δ)$-truss (span-truss) in temporal graphs, a temporal generalization of the $k$-truss, in which $k$ captures the information about the density and $Δ$ captures the time span in which this density holds.

However, understanding factors explaining the production of sequence data is a challenging task, especially since the data generation is often not homogeneous. For example, navigation behavior might change in different phases of browsing a website, or movement behavior may vary between groups of users. In this work, we tackle this task and propose MixedTrails, a Bayesian approach for comparing the plausibility of hypotheses regarding the generative processes of heterogeneous sequence data. Each hypothesis is derived from existing literature, theory or intuition and represents a belief about transition probabilities between a set of states that can vary between groups of observed transitions. For example, when trying to understand human movement in a city and given some observed data, a hypothesis assuming tourists to be more likely to move towards points of interests than locals, can be shown to be more plausible than a hypothesis assuming the opposite. Our approach incorporates such hypotheses as Bayesian priors in a generative mixed transition Markov chain model, and compares their plausibility utilizing Bayes factors. We discuss analytical and approximate inference methods for calculating the marginal likelihoods for Bayes factors, give guidance on interpreting the results, and illustrate our approach with several experiments on synthetic and empirical data from Wikipedia and Flickr.

However IT companies often face a problem while recruiting new people for their ongoing projects due to lack of a proper framework that defines a criteria for the selection process. In this paper we aim to develop a framework that would allow any project manager to take the right decision for selecting new talent by correlating performance parameters with the other domain-specific attributes of the candidates. Also, another important motivation behind this project is to check the validity of the selection procedure often followed by various big companies in both public and private sectors which focus only on academic scores, GPA/grades of students from colleges and other academic backgrounds. We test if such a decision will produce optimal results in the industry or is there a need for change that offers a more holistic approach to recruitment of new talent in the software companies. The scope of this work extends beyond the IT domain and a similar procedure can be adopted to develop a recruitment framework in other fields as well. Data-mining techniques provide useful information from the historical projects depending on which the hiring-manager can make decisions for recruiting high-quality workforce. This study aims to bridge this hiatus by developing a data-mining framework based on an ensemble-learning technique to refocus on the criteria for personnel selection. The results from this research clearly demonstrated that there is a need to refocus on the selection-criteria for quality objectives.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:48.489000

Accessing social network sites such as Twitter, Facebook LinkedIn and Google+ through the internet and the web 2.0 technologies has become more affordable. People are becoming more interested in and relying on social network for information, news and opinion of other users on diverse subject matters. The heavy reliance on social network sites causes them to generate massive data characterised by three computational issues namely; size, noise and dynamism. These issues often make social network data very complex to analyse manually, resulting in the pertinent use of computational means of analysing them. Data mining provides a wide range of techniques for detecting useful knowledge from massive datasets like trends, patterns and rules [44]. Data mining techniques are used for information retrieval, statistical modelling and machine learning. These techniques employ data pre-processing, data analysis, and data interpretation processes in the course of data analysis. This survey discusses different data mining techniques used in mining diverse aspects of the social network over decades going from the historical techniques to the up-to-date models, including our novel technique named TRCM.

The crucial step in frequent pattern mining is frequency counting, which involves a matching operator to find occurrences (instances) of a tree pattern in a given collection of trees. A widely used matching operator for tree-structured data is subtree homeomorphism, where an edge in the tree pattern is mapped onto an ancestor-descendant relationship in the given tree. Tree patterns that are frequent under subtree homeomorphism are usually called embedded patterns. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for subtree homeomorphism with application to frequent pattern mining. We propose a compact data-structure, called occ, which stores only information about the rightmost paths of occurrences and hence can encode and represent several occurrences of a tree pattern. We then define efficient join operations on the occ data-structure, which help us count occurrences of tree patterns according to occurrences of their proper subtrees. Based on the proposed subtree homeomorphism method, we develop an effective pattern mining algorithm, called TPMiner. We evaluate the efficiency of TPMiner on several real-world and synthetic datasets. Our extensive experiments confirm that TPMiner always outperforms well-known existing algorithms, and in several cases the improvement with respect to existing algorithms is significant.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:48.501000

We identify that SPM is suitable for mining learning behaviors, analyzing and enriching educational theories, evaluating the efficacy of instructional interventions, generating features for prediction models, and building educational recommender systems. SPM can contribute to these purposes by discovering similarities and differences in learners' activities and revealing the temporal change in learning behaviors. As a sequential analysis method, SPM can reveal unique insights about learning processes and be powerful for self-regulated learning research. It is more flexible in capturing the relative arrangement of learning events than the other sequential analysis methods.

Ball,2013,"At the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre, we have combined our cloud computing system, CANFAR, with the world's most advanced machine learning software, Skytree, to create the world's first cloud computing system for data mining in astronomy. CANFAR provides a generic environment for the storage and processing of large datasets, removing the requirement to set up and maintain a computing system when implementing an extensive undertaking such as a survey pipeline. 500 processor cores and several hundred terabytes of persistent storage are currently available to users. The storage is implemented via the International Virtual Observatory Alliance's VOSpace protocol, and is accessible both interactively, and to all processing jobs. The user interacts with CANFAR by utilizing virtual machines, which appear to them as equivalent to a desktop. Each machine is replicated as desired to perform large-scale parallel processing. Such an arrangement enables the user to immediately install and run the same astronomy code that they already utilize, in the same way as on a desktop. In addition, unlike many cloud systems, batch job scheduling is handled for the user on multiple virtual machines by the Condor job queueing system. Skytree is installed and run just as any other software on the system, and thus acts as a library of command line data mining functions that can be integrated into one's wider analysis. Thus we have created a generic environment for large-scale analysis by data mining, in the same way that CANFAR itself has done for storage and processing. Because Skytree scales to large data in linear runtime, this allows the full sophistication of the huge fields of data mining and machine learning to be applied to the hundreds of millions of objects that make up current large datasets. We demonstrate the utility of the CANFAR+Skytree system by showing science results obtained. [Abridged]",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:48.519000

Galileo's synoptic observations of the moons of Jupiter and the phases of Venus starting in 1610, provided strong refutation of Ptolemaic cosmology. In more modern times, the discovery of a relationship between period and luminosity in some pulsational variable stars led to the inference of the size of the Milky Way, the distance scale to the nearest galaxies, and the expansion of the Universe. Distant explosions of supernovae were used to uncover the existence of dark energy and provide a precise numerical account of dark matter. Indeed, time-domain observations of transient events and variable stars, as a technique, influences a broad diversity of pursuits in the entire astronomy endeavor. While, at a fundamental level, the nature of the scientific pursuit remains unchanged, the advent of astronomy as a data-driven discipline presents fundamental challenges to the way in which the scientific process must now be conducted. Digital images (and data cubes) are not only getting larger, there are more of them. On logistical grounds, this taxes storage and transport systems. But it also implies that the intimate connection that astronomers have always enjoyed with their data---from collection to processing to analysis to inference---necessarily must evolve.

This, however, leads to the problem of whether the results found by one method are a reflection of the phenomenon shown by the results of another method, or whether the results depict in some sense unrelated properties of the data. For example, using clustering can give indication of a clear cluster structure, and computing correlations between variables can show that there are many significant correlations in the data. However, it can be the case that the correlations are actually determined by the cluster structure.
  In this paper, we consider the problem of randomizing data so that previously discovered patterns or models are taken into account. The randomization methods can be used in iterative data mining. At each step in the data mining process, the randomization produces random samples from the set of data matrices satisfying the already discovered patterns or models. That is, given a data set and some statistics (e.g., cluster centers or co-occurrence counts) of the data, the randomization methods sample data sets having similar values of the given statistics as the original data set. We use Metropolis sampling based on local swaps to achieve this. We describe experiments on real data that demonstrate the usefulness of our approach.

For example, for neurological disorder identification, in addition to the brain networks derived from neuroimaging data, hundreds of clinical, immunologic, serologic and cognitive measures may also be documented for each subject. These measures compose multiple side views encoding a tremendous amount of supplemental information for diagnostic purposes, yet are often ignored.

Motivated by the strengths of prompting, we are the first to explore the potential of prompting speech LMs in the domain of speech processing. Recently, there has been a growing interest in converting speech into discrete units for language modeling. Our pioneer research demonstrates that these quantized speech units are highly versatile within our unified prompting framework. Not only can they serve as class labels, but they also contain rich phonetic information that can be re-synthesized back into speech signals for speech generation tasks. Specifically, we reformulate speech processing tasks into speech-to-unit generation tasks. As a result, we can seamlessly integrate tasks such as speech classification, sequence generation, and speech generation within a single, unified prompting framework. The experiment results show that the prompting method can achieve competitive performance compared to the strong fine-tuning method based on self-supervised learning models with a similar number of trainable parameters. The prompting method also shows promising results in the few-shot setting. Moreover, with the advanced speech LMs coming into the stage, the proposed prompting framework attains great potential.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:48.727000

The database community is becoming increasingly interested in temporal database systems, that are intended to store and manipulate in a principled manner information not only about the present, but also about the past and future. When interfacing to temporal databases, supporting temporal linguistic mechanisms becomes crucial.
  We present a framework for constructing natural language interfaces for temporal databases (NLTDBs), that draws on research in tense and aspect theories, temporal logics, and temporal databases. The framework consists of a temporal intermediate representation language, called TOP, an HPSG grammar that maps a wide range of questions involving temporal mechanisms to appropriate TOP expressions, and a provably correct method for translating from TOP to TSQL2, TSQL2 being a recently proposed temporal extension of the SQL database language. This framework was employed to implement a prototype NLTDB using ALE and Prolog.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:48.730000

These models are typically adapted from text-based large language models (LLMs) through additional training on audio-related tasks. This adaptation process presents two major limitations. First, ALLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where crucial textual capabilities like instruction-following are lost after training on audio data. In some cases, models may even hallucinate sounds that are not present in the input audio, raising concerns about reliability. Second, achieving cross-modal alignment between audio and language typically relies on large collections of task-specific question-answer pairs for instruction tuning, making it resource-intensive. To address these issues, previous works have leveraged the backbone LLMs to synthesize general-purpose, caption-style alignment data. In this paper, we propose a data generation framework that produces contrastive-like training data, designed to enhance ALLMs' ability to differentiate between present and absent sounds. We further extend our approach to multi-audio scenarios, enabling the model to either explain differences between audio inputs or produce unified captions that describe all inputs, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. We refer to the entire ALLM training framework as bootstrapping audio-language alignment via synthetic data generation from backbone LLMs (BALSa).

This study adopts the Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach to discover and antonimize words that were negated for better accuracy in text classification using a knowledge base provided by an NLP library called WordHoard. Early results show that our initial analysis improved on traditional sentiment analysis, which sometimes neglects negations or assigns an inverse polarity score. The SentiWordNet analyzer was improved by 35%, the Vader analyzer by 20% and the TextBlob by 6%.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:48.791000

Using electroencephalography (EEG) as a biomarker for speech decoding has been popular for SSR. However, the lack of SSR text corpus has impeded the development of this technique. Here, we construct a novel task-oriented text corpus, which is utilized in the field of SSR. In the process of construction, we propose a task-oriented hybrid construction method based on natural language generation algorithm. The algorithm focuses on the strategy of data-to-text generation, and has two advantages including linguistic quality and high diversity. These two advantages use template-based method and deep neural networks respectively.

However, in the natural language domain, small perturbations are clearly perceptible, and the replacement of a single word can drastically alter the semantics of the document. Given these challenges, we use a black-box population-based optimization algorithm to generate semantically and syntactically similar adversarial examples that fool well-trained sentiment analysis and textual entailment models with success rates of 97% and 70%, respectively. We additionally demonstrate that 92.3% of the successful sentiment analysis adversarial examples are classified to their original label by 20 human annotators, and that the examples are perceptibly quite similar.

We propose a cooperative game dubbed ""HiddenTables"" as a potential resolution to this challenge. In essence, ""HiddenTables"" is played between the code-generating LLM ""Solver"" and the ""Oracle"" which evaluates the ability of the LLM agents to solve Table QA tasks. This game is based on natural language schemas and importantly, ensures the security of the underlying data. We provide evidential experiments on a diverse set of tables that demonstrate an LLM's collective inability to generalize and perform on complex queries, handle compositional dependencies, and align natural language to programmatic commands when concrete table schemas are provided.

Our infrastructure has spawned a new dataset ""PyQTax"" that spans across 116,671 question-table-answer triplets and provides additional fine-grained breakdowns & labels for varying question taxonomies.

FL has rarely been demonstrated effectively in advanced computer vision tasks such as object detection and image segmentation. To bridge the gap and facilitate the development of FL for computer vision tasks, in this work, we propose a federated learning library and benchmarking framework, named FedCV, to evaluate FL on the three most representative computer vision tasks: image classification, image segmentation, and object detection. We provide non-I.I.D. benchmarking datasets, models, and various reference FL algorithms. Our benchmark study suggests that there are multiple challenges that deserve future exploration: centralized training tricks may not be directly applied to FL; the non-I.I.D. dataset actually downgrades the model accuracy to some degree in different tasks; improving the system efficiency of federated training is challenging given the huge number of parameters and the per-client memory cost. We believe that such a library and benchmark, along with comparable evaluation settings, is necessary to make meaningful progress in FL on computer vision tasks.

Training the network for any given task yields the shapes of the camera's freeform pixels, each of which is implemented using a photodetector and an optical mask.

The performance demonstrated by these systems is on par with a traditional camera with orders of magnitude more pixels. Minimalist vision has two major advantages. First, it naturally tends to preserve the privacy of individuals in the scene since the captured information is inadequate for extracting visual details.

Other region-based approaches use probabilistic analysis such as clustering and Markov random fields, but those methods cannot be used to analyze edges and their interaction. In fact, only image segmentation can produce regions based on edges, but it requires thresholding by simply separating the regions into binary in-out information. Hence, there is currently a gap between edge-based and region-based algorithms, since edges cannot be used to study the properties of a region and vice versa. The objective of this paper is to present a novel spatial probability analysis that allows determining the probability of inclusion inside a set of partial contours (strokes). To answer this objective, we developed a new approach that uses electromagnetic convolutions and repulsion optimization to compute the required probabilities. Hence, it becomes possible to generate a continuous space of probability based only on the edge information, thus bridging the gap between the edge-based methods and the region-based methods. The developed method is consistent with the fundamental properties of inclusion probabilities and its results are validated by comparing an image with the probability-based estimation given by our algorithm.

Often, segmentation models are trained using a single modality, preventing generalization to other types of input data without resorting to transfer learning techniques. Furthermore, the multi-modal or cross-modality architectures proposed in the literature frequently require registered images, which are not easy to collect in clinical environments, or need additional processing steps, such as synthetic image generation.

Extensive experiments assess the behavior of CNN and ViT models under different masking strategies, with a focus on their generalization to OOD backgrounds.

However, while image generation models can produce visually diverse images, single-modality data enhancement techniques still fail to capture the comprehensive knowledge provided by different modalities. Additionally, we note that the performance of TPT-based methods drops significantly when the number of augmented images is limited, which is not unusual given the computational expense of generative augmentation. To address these issues, we introduce IT3A, a novel test-time adaptation method that utilizes a pre-trained generative model for multi-modal augmentation of each test sample from unknown new domains. By combining augmented data from pre-trained vision and language models, we enhance the ability of the model to adapt to unknown new test data. Additionally, to ensure that key semantics are accurately retained when generating various visual and text enhancements, we employ cosine similarity filtering between the logits of the enhanced images and text with the original test data. This process allows us to filter out some spurious augmentation and inadequate combinations. To leverage the diverse enhancements provided by the generation model across different modals, we have replaced prompt tuning with an adapter for greater flexibility in utilizing text templates.

At the end of this study, we further the proposed mechanism to statistical Kernelized Bayesian Regression, so that uncertainty modeling with incremental/decremental computation becomes applicable. Experimental results showed that computational time was significantly reduced, better than the original nonincremental design and the typical single incremental method. Furthermore, the accuracy of the proposed method remained the same as the baselines. This implied that the system enhanced efficiency without sacrificing the accuracy. These findings proved that the proposed method was appropriate for variable streaming data analysis, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:51.263000

Latimer,2018,"Many studies of neural activity in behaving animals aim to discover interpretable low-dimensional structure in large-scale neural population recordings. One approach to this problem is demixed principal component analysis (dPCA), a supervised linear dimensionality reduction technique to find components that depend on particular experimental parameters. Here, I introduce kernel dPCA (kdPCA) as a nonlinear extension of dPCA by applying kernel least-squares regression to the demixing problem. I consider simulated examples of neural populations with low-dimensional activity to compare the components recovered from dPCA and kdPCA. These simulations demonstrate that neurally relevant nonlinearities, such as stimulus-dependent gain and rotation, interfere with linear demixing of neural activity into components that represent to individual experimental parameters. However, kdPCA can still recover interpretable components in these examples.

Simply turning an image array into a long vector causes extremely high dimensionality that compromises classical regression methods, and, more seriously, destroys the inherent spatial structure of array data that possesses wealth of information. In this article, we propose a family of generalized linear tensor regression models based upon the Tucker decomposition of regression coefficient arrays. Effectively exploiting the low rank structure of tensor covariates brings the ultrahigh dimensionality to a manageable level that leads to efficient estimation. We demonstrate, both numerically that the new model could provide a sound recovery of even high rank signals, and asymptotically that the model is consistently estimating the best Tucker structure approximation to the full array model in the sense of Kullback-Liebler distance.

The difficulties mainly arise from the intrinsic complexity of the MHD equations as well as the indeterminate relation between the PP property and the divergence-free condition on magnetic field. We present the first rigorous PP analysis of conservative schemes with Lax-Friedrichs (LF) flux for ideal MHD. The significant innovation is the discovery of theoretical connection between PP property and a discrete divergence-free (DDF) condition. This connection is established through the generalized LF splitting properties, which are alternatives of the usually-expected LF splitting property that does not hold for ideal MHD. The generalized LF splitting properties involve a number of admissible states strongly coupled by DDF condition, making their derivation very difficult. We derive these properties via a novel equivalent form of the admissible state set and an important inequality skillfully constructed by technical estimates. Rigorous PP analysis is presented for finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin schemes with LF flux on uniform Cartesian meshes. In 1D case, PP property is proved for the first-order scheme with proper numerical viscosity, and also for arbitrarily high-order schemes under conditions accessible by a PP limiter. In 2D case, we show that the DDF condition is necessary and crucial for achieving PP property. It is observed that even slightly violating the proposed DDF condition may cause failure to preserve the positivity of pressure. We prove that the 2D LF type scheme with proper numerical viscosity preserves the positivity and DDF condition.

We prove that the sparse estimator from such a method can retain all of the important variables asymptotically for even exponentially growing dimensionality under regularity conditions. This indicates that the best subset regression method can efficiently shrink the full model down to a submodel of a size less than the sample size, which can be analyzed by well-developed regression techniques for such cases in a follow-up study.

OSS is an EM algorithm, and thus possesses the monotonicity property. For any sparse estimator, OSS can improve its fit of the model by putting it as an initial point. After this improvement, the sparsity of the estimator is kept. Another appealing feature of OSS is that, similarly to an effective algorithm for a continuous optimization problem, OSS can converge to the global solution to the \ell0-norm constrained regression problem if the initial point lies in a neighborhood of the global solution.

While blood tests provide accurate measurements, they are invasive and the laboratory analysis can be slow or inaccessible. In contrast, an electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely adopted tool which is quick and simple to acquire. However, the problem of estimating continuous electrolyte concentrations directly from ECGs is not well-studied. We therefore investigate if regression methods can be used for accurate ECG-based prediction of electrolyte concentrations. Methods: We explore the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for this task. We analyze the regression performance across four electrolytes, utilizing a novel dataset containing over 290000 ECGs. For improved understanding, we also study the full spectrum from continuous predictions to binary classification of extreme concentration levels. To enhance clinical usefulness, we finally extend to a probabilistic regression approach and evaluate different uncertainty estimates. Results: We find that the performance varies significantly between different electrolytes, which is clinically justified in the interplay of electrolytes and their manifestation in the ECG. We also compare the regression accuracy with that of traditional machine learning models, demonstrating superior performance of DNNs.

The latter, however, is often influenced by certain factors which are beyond control of the units, and one would like to extract an adjusted performance from the data. Specifically, let $X_i \in \mathcal{X}$ summarize the factors of the $i$-th unit. Then one could think of a model equation $Y_i = f_o(X_i) + ε_i$ with a regression function $f_o : \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}$ describing the unavoidable influence of the factors $X_i$ and $ε_i$ being the adjusted performance of the $i$-th unit. Now a common proposal is to estimate $f_o$ via regression methods by a function $\hat{f}$ depending on the current data $(X_i,Y_i)$, possibly augmented by additional past data, and to use the residuals $\hatε_i := Y_i - \hat{f}(X_i)$ as surrogates for the adjusted performances $ε_i$.

Among thousands of genes whose expression levels are measured, not all are needed for discriminant analysis: a gene may either not contribute to the separation of two types of tissues/cancers, or it may be redundant because it is highly correlated with other genes. There are two theoretical frameworks in which variable selection (or gene selection in our case) can be addressed. The first is model selection, and the second is model averaging. We have carried out model selection using Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion with logistic regression (discrimination, prediction, or classification) to determine the number of genes that provide the best model. These model selection criteria set upper limits of 22-25 and 12-13 genes for this data set with 38 samples, and the best model consists of only one (no.4847, zyxin) or two genes. We have also carried out model averaging over the best single-gene logistic predictors using three different weights: maximized likelihood, prediction rate on training set, and equal weight. We have observed that the performance of most of these weighted predictors on the testing set is gradually reduced as more genes are included, but a clear cutoff that separates good and bad prediction performance is not found.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:51.324000

We propose an efficient ODC framework, which is applicable to various regression models and in particular reduces the complexity of Twin Gaussian Processes (TGP) regression from cubic to quadratic. Our notion is also applicable to several kernel methods (e.g., Gaussian Process Regression(GPR) and IWTGP regression, as shown in our experiments).

For both methods, we provide an explicit and efficiently computable expression for the limiting predictive risk, which depends only on the spectrum of the feature-covariance matrix, the signal strength, and the aspect ratio $γ$. Especially in the case of regularized discriminant analysis, we find that predictive accuracy has a nuanced dependence on the eigenvalue distribution of the covariance matrix, suggesting that analyses based on the operator norm of the covariance matrix may not be sharp. Our results also uncover several qualitative insights about both methods: for example, with ridge regression, there is an exact inverse relation between the limiting predictive risk and the limiting estimation risk given a fixed signal strength.

Such an approach can be useful in learning the relationship between input and output when the regression parameters for estimating output are different in different regions of the input space. Variational Inference (VI), a machine learning approach to obtain posterior probability densities using optimization techniques, is used to identify clusters of explanatory variables and regression parameters for each cluster. From these results, one can obtain both the expected value and the full distribution of predicted output. Other advantages of the proposed approach include the elegant theoretical solution and clear interpretability of results. The proposed approach is well-suited for financial forecasting where markets have different regimes (or clusters) with different patterns and correlations of market changes in each regime. In financial applications, knowledge about such clusters can provide useful insights about portfolio performance and identify the relative importance of variables in different market regimes. An illustrative example of predicting one-day S&P change is considered to illustrate the approach and compare the performance of the proposed approach with standard regression without clusters.

We also formalize the regression test window between any two builds, which captures the limited time budget available for regression testing. As the time limit is set to infinity and the chain is closed to two builds, the model degenerates to retest-all, thereby preserving semantics for the classical two-version case.

This is a major contribution over existing results in reduced rank regression, which mainly focus on rank selection and prediction consistency. Our theoretical results quantify the tradeoff between heavy-tailedness of the random noise and statistical bias. For random noise with bounded $(1+δ)$th moment with $δ\in (0,1)$, the rate of convergence is a function of $δ$, and is slower than the sub-Gaussian-type deviation bounds; for random noise with bounded second moment, we obtain a rate of convergence as if sub-Gaussian noise were assumed.

It has important applications in, e.g., machine learning and influence maximization. Though the theoretical problem admits polynomial-time approximation algorithms, solving it in practice often involves frequently querying submodular functions that are expensive to compute. This has motivated significant research into designing parallel approximation algorithms in the adaptive complexity model; adaptive complexity (adaptivity) measures the number of sequential rounds of $\text{poly}(n)$ function queries an algorithm requires. The state-of-the-art algorithms can achieve $(1-\frac{1}{e}-\varepsilon)$-approximate solutions with $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}\log n)$ adaptivity, which approaches the known adaptivity lower-bounds. However, the $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \log n)$ adaptivity only applies to maximizing worst-case functions that are unlikely to appear in practice. Thus, in this paper, we consider the special class of $p$-superseparable submodular functions, which places a reasonable constraint on $f$, based on the parameter $p$, and is more amenable to maximization, while also having real-world applicability. Our main contribution is the algorithm LS+GS, a finer-grained version of the existing LS+PGB algorithm, designed for instances of SMCC when $f$ is $p$-superseparable; it achieves an expected $(1-\frac{1}{e}-\varepsilon)$-approximate solution with $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}\log(p k))$ adaptivity independent of $n$. Additionally, unrelated to $p$-superseparability, our LS+GS algorithm uses only $O(\frac{n}{\varepsilon} + \frac{\log n}{\varepsilon^2})$ oracle queries, which has an improved dependence on $\varepsilon^{-1}$ over the state-of-the-art LS+PGB; this is achieved through the design of a novel thresholding subroutine.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:55.986000

In contrast to Lie supergroups, the arising representation-theoretical Lie supergroups (RTLSG) occur as families associated to Harish-Chandra superpairs. However morphisms of RTLSGs directly correspond to morphisms of Harish-Chandra superpairs. Particular RTLSGs can be derived from the explicit constructions of Lie supergroups given by Berezin and Kostant. The Lie superalgebras $\mathfrak{gl}(1,1)$ or $\mathfrak{sl}(1,1)$ appearing also in higher dimensional classical Lie superalgebras, provide interesting first examples of RTLSGs.

The experimental result analysis based on the image quality assessment for image decolorization called C2G-SSIM and success rate (Cadik and COLOR250 datasets) shows that the proposed image decolorization technique performs better than 8 existing benchmark algorithms for image decolorization. In the second part of the paper, the effectiveness of incorporating the chrominance component in scene classification task is demonstrated using the deep belief network (DBN) based image classification system developed using dense scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) as features.

Using tools from CSP (in particular Thapper and Živný, 2012) to study the existence of such relaxations, we provide a much broader class of half-integral polytopes with the required properties, unifying and extending previously known cases.
  In addition to the insight into problems with half-integral relaxations, our results yield a range of new and improved FPT algorithms, including an $O^*(|Σ|^{2k})$-time algorithm for node-deletion Unique Label Cover with label set $Σ$ and an $O^*(4^k)$-time algorithm for Group Feedback Vertex Set, including the setting where the group is only given by oracle access. All these significantly improve on previous results. The latter result also implies the first single-exponential time FPT algorithm for Subset Feedback Vertex Set, answering an open question of Cygan et al. (2012).
  Additionally, we propose a network flow-based approach to solve some cases of the relaxation problem. This gives the first linear-time FPT algorithm to edge-deletion Unique Label Cover.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:56.053000

Filling them so they are level, as fluid would fill them if the terrain were impermeable, is often necessary in preprocessing DEMs. The depression-filling algorithm presented here---called Priority-Flood---unifies and improves on the work of a number of previous authors who have published similar algorithms. The algorithm operates by flooding DEMs inwards from their edges using a priority queue to determine the next cell to be flooded. The resultant DEM has no depressions or digital dams: every cell is guaranteed to drain. The algorithm is optimal for both integer and floating-point data, working in O(n) and O(n lg n) time, respectively. It is shown that by using a plain queue to fill depressions once they have been found, an O(m lg m) time-complexity can be achieved, where m does not exceed the number of cells n. This is the lowest time complexity of any known floating-point depression-filling algorithm. In testing, this improved variation of the algorithm performed up to 37% faster than the original. Additionally, a parallel version of an older, but widely-used depression-filling algorithm required six parallel processors to achieve a run-time on par with what the newer algorithm's improved variation took on a single processor. The Priority-Flood Algorithm is simple to understand and implement: the included pseudocode is only 20 lines and the included C++ reference implementation is under a hundred lines. The algorithm can work on irregular meshes as well as 4-, 6-, 8-, and n-connected grids.

It works by solving the SDP relaxation of [Arora-Rao-Vazirani, STOC 2004] using the Multiplicative Weights Update algorithm (MW) of [Arora-Kale, JACM 2016]. To implement one MW step, Sherman approximately solves a multicommodity flow problem using another application of MW. Nested MW steps are solved via a certain ``chaining'' algorithm that combines results of multiple calls to the maxflow algorithm. We present an alternative approach that avoids solving the multicommodity flow problem and instead computes ``violating paths''. This simplifies Sherman's algorithm by removing a need for a nested application of MW, and also allows parallelization: we show how to compute $O(\sqrt{(\log n)/\varepsilon})$-approximation via $O(\log^{O(1)}n)$ maxflows using $O(n^\varepsilon)$ processors.

Specifically, in the edge-connectivity version, EC-kRC, the requirement is that there are at most (k-1) edge-disjoint paths connecting s_i to t_i in G \ E', while in the vertex-connectivity version, NC-kRC, the same requirement is for vertex-disjoint paths. Prior to our work, poly-logarithmic approximation algorithms have been known for the special case where k >= 3, but no non-trivial approximation algorithms were known for any value k>3, except in the single-source setting. We show an O(k log^{3/2}r)-approximation algorithm for EC-kRC with uniform edge weights, and several polylogarithmic bi-criteria approximation algorithms for EC-kRC and NC-kRC, where the connectivity requirement k is violated by a constant factor. We complement these upper bounds by proving that NC-kRC is hard to approximate to within a factor of k^{eps} for some fixed eps>0.
  We then turn to study a simpler version of NC-kRC, where only one source-sink pair is present. We give a simple bi-criteria approximation algorithm for this case, and show evidence that even this restricted version of the problem may be hard to approximate.

The approach tries to reveal the hierarchical structural information through reducing the graph into a more concise one repeatedly. With the reductions, the original graph can be divided into subgraphs recursively, and a lite informative dendrogram is constructed based on the divisions. The reduction consists of three steps: selection, connection, and partition. First a subset of vertices of the graph are selected as representatives to build a concise graph. The representatives are re-connected to maintain a consistent structure with the previous graph. If possible, the concise graph is divided into subgraphs, and each subgraph is further reduced recursively until the termination condition is met. We discuss the approach, along with several selection and connection methods, in detail both theoretically and experimentally in this paper. Our implementations run in linear time and achieve outstanding performance on various types of datasets.

Since clustering analysis is one of the best ways to find some clarity and structure within raw data, this paper explores a novel approach to \textit{k}-means clustering. Here we present a \textit{k}-means clustering algorithm that takes both the within cluster distance (WCD) and the inter cluster distance (ICD) as the distance metric to cluster the data into \emph{k} clusters pre-determined by the Calinski-Harabasz criterion in order to provide a more robust output for the clustering analysis. The idea with this approach is that by including both the measurement metrics, the convergence of the data into their clusters becomes solidified and more robust. We run the algorithm with some synthetically produced data and also some benchmark data sets obtained from the UCI repository. The results show that the convergence of the data into their respective clusters is more accurate by using both WCD and ICD measurement metrics. The algorithm is also better at clustering the outliers into their true clusters as opposed to the traditional \textit{k} means method.

Here we develop a new method for solving the minimization problem, which can handle data sets at least two orders of magnitude larger. In doing so, we elucidate the underlying structure of uncertainty minimization using multiple geometric representations.

We show that modularity, a standard quality function for graph clustering, does not satisfy all of these six properties. This motivates the derivation of a new family of quality functions, adaptive scale modularity, which does satisfy the proposed axioms. Adaptive scale modularity has two parameters, which give greater flexibility in the kinds of clusterings that can be found. Standard graph clustering quality functions, such as normalized cut and unnormalized cut, are obtained as special cases of adaptive scale modularity.

Several heuristics of this type have been proposed in the literature, but little is known about their relative performance.
  This paper experimentally compares existing and new coarsening- and refinement-based heuristics with respect to their effectiveness (achieved modularity) and efficiency (runtime). Concerning coarsening, it turns out that the most widely used criterion for merging clusters (modularity increase) is outperformed by other simple criteria, and that a recent algorithm by Schuetz and Caflisch is no improvement over simple greedy coarsening for these criteria. Concerning refinement, a new multi-level algorithm is shown to produce significantly better clusterings than conventional single-level algorithms.

In this paper, we consider situations in which data live in a physical world, so we have to first collect the images using sensors before clustering them. Using sensors enhanced by quantum entanglement, we can image surfaces more accurately than using purely classical strategies. However, it is not immediately obvious if the advantage we gain is robust enough to survive data processing steps such as clustering. It has previously been found that using quantum-enhanced sensors for imaging and pattern recognition can give an advantage for supervised learning tasks, and here we demonstrate that this advantage also holds for an unsupervised learning task, namely clustering.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:59.515000

Applications of this ansatz have provided a semi-empirical analytical description of gravitational clustering which is extremely useful. This contribution examines the two theoretical ingredients that form the basis of these applications: self-similar evolution and the stable clustering hypothesis. A brief summary of work verifying self-similar scaling for scale free spectra $P(k) \propto k^n$, with $n < -1$ is given. The main results presented here examine the hypothesis that clustering is statistically stable in time on small scales, or equivalently that the mean pair velocity in physical coordinates is zero. The mean pair velocity of particles can be computed accurately from N-body simulations via the pair conservation equation, by using the evolution of the autocorrelation function $ξ(x,t)$. The results thus obtained for scale free spectra with $n = 0, -1, -2$ and for the CDM spectrum are consistent with the stable clustering prediction on the smallest resolved scales, on which the amplitude of $ξ\gsim 200-1000$ for $n = -2$ and $n = 0$, respectively.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:59.520000

  In this paper, we propose ClusterGAN as a new mechanism for clustering using GANs. By sampling latent variables from a mixture of one-hot encoded variables and continuous latent variables, coupled with an inverse network (which projects the data to the latent space) trained jointly with a clustering specific loss, we are able to achieve clustering in the latent space. Our results show a remarkable phenomenon that GANs can preserve latent space interpolation across categories, even though the discriminator is never exposed to such vectors.

Ball",2009,"  The use of photometric redshifts in cosmology is increasing. Often, however these photo-zs are treated like spectroscopic observations, in that the peak of the photometric redshift, rather than the full probability density function (PDF), is used. This overlooks useful information inherent in the full PDF. We introduce a new real-space estimator for one of the most used cosmological statistics, the 2-point correlation function, that weights by the PDF of individual photometric objects in a manner that is optimal when Poisson statistics dominate. As our estimator does not bin based on the PDF peak it substantially enhances the clustering signal by usefully incorporating information from all photometric objects that overlap the redshift bin of interest. As a real-world application, we measure QSO clustering in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that our simplest binned estimator improves the clustering signal by a factor equivalent to increasing the survey size by a factor of 2-3. We also introduce a new implementation that fully weights between pairs of objects in constructing the cross-correlation and find that this pair-weighted estimator improves clustering signal in a manner equivalent to increasing the survey size by a factor of 4-5. Our technique uses spectroscopic data to anchor the distance scale and it will be particularly useful where spectroscopic data (e.g, from BOSS) overlaps deeper photometry (e.g.,from Pan-STARRS, DES or the LSST). We additionally provide simple, informative expressions to determine when our estimator will be competitive with the autocorrelation of spectroscopic objects.

We first consider the case where the regularization term is the sum of the squared size of the clusters, and then generalize it to adaptive regularization of the pairwise similarities.

Recently, graph data distillation (GDD), which seeks to distill large graphs into compact and informative ones, has emerged as a promising technique to enable efficient GNN training. However, most existing GDD works rely on heuristics that align model gradients or representation distributions on condensed and original graphs, leading to compromised result quality, expensive training for distilling large graphs, or both. Motivated by this, this paper presents an efficient and effective GDD approach, ClustGDD. Under the hood, ClustGDD resorts to synthesizing the condensed graph and node attributes through fast and theoretically-grounded clustering that minimizes the within-cluster sum of squares and maximizes the homophily on the original graph. The fundamental idea is inspired by our empirical and theoretical findings unveiling the connection between clustering and empirical condensation quality using Fréchet Inception Distance, a well-known quality metric for synthetic images. Furthermore, to mitigate the adverse effects caused by the homophily-based clustering, ClustGDD refines the nodal attributes of the condensed graph with a small augmentation learned via class-aware graph sampling and consistency loss. Our extensive experiments exhibit that GNNs trained over condensed graphs output by ClustGDD consistently achieve superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art GDD methods in terms of node classification on five benchmark datasets, while being orders of magnitude faster.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:48:59.544000

We show that, in the classic stochastic block model setting, it outperforms existing methods by polynomial factors when the cluster size is allowed to have general scalings. In fact, it is within logarithmic factors of known lower bounds for spectral methods, and there is evidence suggesting that no polynomial time algorithm would do significantly better.

Given an MRG G with N nodes, partitioning the node set therein into K disjoint clusters (MRGC) is a fundamental task in analyzing MRGs, which has garnered considerable attention. However, the majority of existing solutions towards MRGC either yield severely compromised result quality by ineffective fusion of heterogeneous graph structures and attributes, or struggle to cope with sizable MRGs with millions of nodes and billions of edges due to the adoption of sophisticated and costly deep learning models.
  In this paper, we present DEMM and DEMM+, two effective MRGC approaches to address the limitations above. Specifically, our algorithms are built on novel two-stage optimization objectives, where the former seeks to derive high-caliber node feature vectors by optimizing the multi-relational Dirichlet energy specialized for MRGs, while the latter minimizes the Dirichlet energy of clustering results over the node affinity graph. In particular, DEMM+ achieves significantly higher scalability and efficiency over our based method DEMM through a suite of well-thought-out optimizations. Key technical contributions include (i) a highly efficient approximation solver for constructing node feature vectors, and (ii) a theoretically-grounded problem transformation with carefully-crafted techniques that enable linear-time clustering without explicitly materializing the NxN dense affinity matrix. Further, we extend DEMM+ to handle attribute-less MRGs through non-trivial adaptations.

We find that more massive galaxies cluster more strongly than less massive galaxies, with the difference increasing above the characteristic stellar mass of the Schechter mass function. When divided by physical quantities, galaxies with redder colours, larger D4000, higher C and larger μ_* cluster more strongly. The clustering differences are largest on small scales and for low mass galaxies. At fixed stellar mass,the dependences of clustering on colour and 4000A break strength are similar. Different results are obtained when galaxies are split by concentration or surface density. The dependence of w(r_p) on g-r and D4000 extends out to physical scales that are significantly larger than those of individual dark matter haloes (> 5 Mpc/h). This large-scale clustering dependence is not seen for the parameters C or μ_*. On small scales (< 1 Mpc/h), the amplitude of the correlation function is constant for ``young'' galaxies with 1.1 < D4000< 1.5 and a steeply rising function of age for ``older'' galaxies with D4000>1.5. In contrast, the dependence of the amplitude of w(r_p) on concentration on scales less than 1 Mpc/h is strongest for disk-dominated galaxies with C<2.6.

Carbon accounting frameworks based exclusively on national forest inventories are limited to broad-scale estimates, but model-based approaches that combine these inventories with remotely sensed data can yield contiguous fine-resolution maps of forest biomass and carbon stocks across landscapes over time. Here we describe a fundamental step in building a map-based stock-change framework: mapping historical forest biomass at fine temporal and spatial resolution (annual, 30m) across all of New York State (USA) from 1990 to 2019, using freely available data and open-source tools.
  Using Landsat imagery, US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data, and off-the-shelf LiDAR collections we developed three modeling approaches for mapping historical forest aboveground biomass (AGB): training on FIA plot-level AGB estimates (direct), training on LiDAR-derived AGB maps (indirect), and an ensemble averaging predictions from the direct and indirect models. Model prediction surfaces (maps) were tested against FIA estimates at multiple scales. All three approaches produced viable outputs, yet tradeoffs were evident in terms of model complexity, map accuracy, saturation, and fine-scale pattern representation. The resulting map products can help identify where, when, and how forest carbon stocks are changing as a result of both anthropogenic and natural drivers alike.

Autoregressive models have some theoretical advantage over currently employed forest modeling approaches such as Markov chains and individual-based models, as autoregressive models are both analytically tractable and operate with continuous state space. We perform time series statistical analysis of forest biomass and basal area recorded in Quebec provincial forest inventories in 1970-2007. The geometric random walk model adequately describes the yearly average dynamics. For individual patches, we fit an AR(1) process capable to model negative feedback (mean-reversion). Overall, the best fit also turns out to be geometric random walk, however, the normality tests for residuals fail. In contrast, yearly means are adequately described by normal fluctuations, with annual growth, on average, 2.3%, but with standard deviation of order 40%. We use Bayesian analysis to account for uneven number of observations per year. This work demonstrates that autoregressive models represent a valuable tool for modeling of forest dynamics. In particular, they quantify stochastic effects of environmental disturbances and develop predictive empirical models on short and intermediate temporal scales.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:16.537000

Such an evolution of carbon price is generally associated with economically efficient climate change mitigation, and would provide incentives for the land-owner for enhanced carbon sequestration. With an infinitely long sequence of even-aged forest rotations, the optimal harvest age changes with subsequent rotations due to the changing carbon price. The first-order optimality conditions therefore also involve an infinite chain of lengths for consecutive forest rotations, and allow the approximation of the infinite-time problem with a truncated series of forest rotations.
  Illustrative numerical calculations show that when starting from bare land, the initial carbon price and its growth rate both primarily increase the length of the first rotation. With some combinations of the carbon pricing parameters, the optimal harvest age can be several hundred years if the forest carbon is released to the atmosphere upon harvest. This effect is not, however, entirely monotonous. Consequently, the currently optimal harvest ages are generally lower with higher rates of carbon price increase. This creates an interesting temporal aspect, suggesting that the supply of wood and carbon sequestration by forests can change considerably during subsequent rotations under an increasing price on carbon.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:16.538000

However, due to weather extremes and uncertainties, most forecasting models for crop yield are not reliable and accurate. For measuring the uncertainty and obtaining further information of future crop yields, a probability density forecasting model based on quantile random forest and Epanechnikov kernel function (QRF-SJ) is proposed. The nonlinear structure of random forest is applied to change the quantile regression model for building the probabilistic forecasting model. Epanechnikov kernel function and solve-the equation plug-in approach of Sheather and Jones are used in the kernel density estimation. A case study using the annual crop yield of groundnut and millet in Ghana is presented to illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed technique. The values of the prediction interval coverage probability and prediction interval normalized average width for the two crops show that the constructed prediction intervals capture the observed yields with high coverage probability. The probability density curves show that QRF-SJ method has a very high ability to forecast quality prediction intervals with a higher coverage probability. The feature importance gave a score of the importance of each weather variable in building the quantile regression forest model.

We do this by relating our random graphs to branching processes, which are much easier to analyze.

Performances of the harvester models were evaluated using national forest inventory plots in an 8.7 Mha study area.

The bias of the synthetic estimator was largest for N (39%) and smallest for V (1%).

We investigate the random variable X_w^n that counts the fixed points in this permutation when the s_i are selected uniformly at random. A major ingredient of our work is a new categorization of words which considerably extends the dichotomy of primitive vs. imprimitive words. We establish some results and make a few conjectures about the relation between the expectation E(X_w^n) and this new categorization.
  This analysis contributes deeply to our study of the spectra of random lifts of graphs. Let G be a connected graph, and let the infinite tree T be its universal cover space. If L and R are the spectral radii of G and T respectively, then, as shown by J. Friedman, for almost every n-lift H of G, all ""new"" eigenvalues of H are < O(L^(1/2)R^(1/2)).

This is a generalization of the problem of bounding the second eigenvalue in a random 2d-regular graph.
  As an aside, we obtain a new conceptual and relatively simple proof of a theorem of A. Nica, which determines, for every fixed w, the limit distribution (as n \to \infty) of X_w^n.

Our results suggest that SAM2 not only has impressive generalization capabilities, but also can form a natural synergy with specialized methods trained on in-domain labeled data.

Snasel",2021,"Random Forest is an ensemble of decision trees based on the bagging and random subspace concepts. As suggested by Breiman, the strength of unstable learners and the diversity among them are the ensemble models' core strength. In this paper, we propose two approaches known as oblique and rotation double random forests. In the first approach, we propose rotation based double random forest. In rotation based double random forests, transformation or rotation of the feature space is generated at each node. At each node different random feature subspace is chosen for evaluation, hence the transformation at each node is different. Different transformations result in better diversity among the base learners and hence, better generalization performance. With the double random forest as base learner, the data at each node is transformed via two different transformations namely, principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis. In the second approach, we propose oblique double random forest. Decision trees in random forest and double random forest are univariate, and this results in the generation of axis parallel split which fails to capture the geometric structure of the data. Also, the standard random forest may not grow sufficiently large decision trees resulting in suboptimal performance. To capture the geometric properties and to grow the decision trees of sufficient depth, we propose oblique double random forest. The oblique double random forest models are multivariate decision trees. At each non-leaf node, multisurface proximal support vector machine generates the optimal plane for better generalization performance. Also, different regularization techniques are employed for tackling the small sample size problems in the decision trees of oblique double random forest.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:16.617000

Firstly, we provide theoretical guarantees to link finite forests used in practice (with a finite number M of trees) to their asymptotic counterparts. Using empirical process theory, we prove a uniform central limit theorem for a large class of random forest estimates, which holds in particular for Breiman's original forests. Secondly, we show that infinite forest consistency implies finite forest consistency and thus, we state the consistency of several infinite forests.

The individual area or the area potentially available (APA) to an individual plant embodies an idea widely used in population ecology but it has fewer applications in forest research. It was used a Voronoi/ Thiessen tessellation in order to determine the individual area of each sapling. The study was conducted in a naturally regenerated area; using data collected from over seven thousands saplings positioned in a network of permanent rectangular sampling plots. The Voronoi/ Thiessen polygons were used to characterize spatial pattern of sapling distribution as well as the competition relations between the individuals. It is obvious that, at least from the mathematically point of view, the Voronoi tessellation represents one of the best solutions to determine neighbouring competitors of a tree. There were studied the correlations between APA values and the main biometrical attributes, height growth and competition indices. Furthermore, it is shown that APA coefficient of variation is a straight-forward indicator with positive results as an indicator of spatial pattern.

Bagging enhances the diversity by sampling with replacement and generating many training data sets, while random forest adds selecting a random number of features as well. This has made the random forest a winning candidate for many machine learning applications.

Little",2025,"We present an axiomatic framework for analyzing the algorithmic properties of decision trees. This framework supports the classification of decision tree problems through structural and ancestral constraints within a rigorous mathematical foundation. The central focus of this paper is a special class of decision tree problems-which we term proper decision trees-due to their versatility and effectiveness. In terms of versatility, this class subsumes several well-known data structures, including binary space partitioning trees, K-D trees, and machine learning decision tree models. Regarding effectiveness, we prove that only proper decision trees can be uniquely characterized as K-permutations, whereas typical non-proper decision trees correspond to binary-labeled decision trees with substantially greater complexity. Using this formal characterization, we develop a generic algorithmic approach for solving optimal decision tree problems over arbitrary splitting rules and objective functions for proper decision trees. We constructively derive a generic dynamic programming recursion for solving these problems exactly. However, we show that memoization is generally impractical in terms of space complexity, as both datasets and subtrees must be stored. This result contradicts claims in the literature that suggest a trade-off between memoizing datasets and subtrees. Our framework further accommodates constraints such as tree depth and leaf size, and can be accelerated using techniques such as thinning. Finally, we extend our analysis to several non-proper decision trees, including the commonly studied decision tree over binary feature data, the binary search tree, and the tree structure arising in the matrix chain multiplication problem. We demonstrate how these problems can be solved by appropriately modifying or discarding certain axioms.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:36.688000

Specifically, we extend the impurity calculation and the pure ending condition of the classical decision tree to propose a decision tree extension that allows the use of soft labels generated by a well-trained teacher model in training and prediction process. It is worth noting that for the acquisition of soft labels, we propose a new multiple cross-validation based method to reduce the effects of randomness and overfitting. These approaches ensure that ReDT retains excellent interpretability and even achieves fewer nodes than the decision tree in the aspect of compression while having relatively good performance. Besides, in contrast to traditional knowledge distillation, back propagation of the student model is not necessarily required in ReDT, which is an attempt of a new knowledge distillation approach. Extensive experiments are conducted, which demonstrates the superiority of ReDT in interpretability, compression, and empirical soundness.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:36.692000

In each decision node, only the best-performing model SVM -- the one that minimizes an impurity measure for the n-ary classification -- is retained, even if the learned SVM addresses a binary classification subtask. An extensive experimental study involving 49 datasets and various state-of-the-art algorithms for oblique decision tree ensembles has been conducted. Our results show that ODTE ranks consistently above its competitors, achieving significant performance gains when hyperparameters are carefully tuned.

The generalized approach is free of the standard paradoxes of classical decision theory. This approach also explains the error-attenuation effects observed for the paradoxes occurring when decision makers, who are members of a society, consult with each other, increasing in this way the available mutual information.

These definitions are stated unambiguously through executable recursive programs, satisfying all criteria we propose for a formal specification. In this sense, they resemble the ""standard form"" used in the study of general-purpose solvers.
  Grounded in algebraic programming theory-a relational formalism for deriving correct-by-construction algorithms from specifications-we can not only establish the existence or nonexistence of dynamic programming solutions but also derive them constructively whenever they exist. Consequently, the four generic problem definitions yield four novel optimal algorithms for ODT problems with arbitrary splitting rules that satisfy the axioms and objective functions of a given form. These algorithms encompass the known depth-constrained, axis-parallel ODT algorithm as the special case, while providing a unified, efficient, and elegant solution for the general ODT problem.

A common approach involves using a fixed decision tree as one player's strategy while training an RL agent as the opponent to identify vulnerabilities in the decision tree, thereby improving its strategic strength iteratively. However, this process often requires significant human intervention to refine the decision tree after identifying its weaknesses, resulting in inefficiencies and hindering full automation of the strategy enhancement process. Fortunately, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a transformative opportunity to automate the process. We propose RL-LLM-DT, an automatic decision tree generation method based on RL Evaluation and LLM Enhancement. Given an initial decision tree, the method involves two important iterative steps. Response Policy Search: RL is used to discover counter-strategies targeting the decision tree. Policy Improvement: LLMs analyze failure scenarios and generate improved decision tree code. In our method, RL focuses on finding the decision tree's flaws while LLM is prompted to generate an improved version of the decision tree. The iterative refinement process terminates when RL can't find any flaw of the tree or LLM fails to improve the tree. To evaluate the effectiveness of this integrated approach, we conducted experiments in a curling game. After iterative refinements, our curling AI based on the decision tree ranks first on the Jidi platform among 34 curling AIs in total, which demonstrates that LLMs can significantly enhance the robustness and adaptability of decision trees, representing a substantial advancement in the field of Game AI.

Allman, James H. Degnan, John A. Rhodes",2009,"Gene trees are evolutionary trees representing the ancestry of genes sampled from multiple populations. Species trees represent populations of individuals -- each with many genes -- splitting into new populations or species. The coalescent process, which models ancestry of gene copies within populations, is often used to model the probability distribution of gene trees given a fixed species tree. This multispecies coalescent model provides a framework for phylogeneticists to infer species trees from gene trees using maximum likelihood or Bayesian approaches. Because the coalescent models a branching process over time, all trees are typically assumed to be rooted in this setting. Often, however, gene trees inferred by traditional phylogenetic methods are unrooted.
  We investigate probabilities of unrooted gene trees under the multispecies coalescent model. We show that when there are 4 species with one gene sampled per species, the distribution of unrooted gene tree topologies identifies the unrooted species tree topology and some, but not all, information in the species tree edges (branch lengths). The location of the root on the species tree is not identifiable in this situation. However, for 5 or more species with one gene sampled per species, we show that the distribution of unrooted gene tree topologies identifies the rooted species tree topology and all its internal branch lengths. The length of any pendent branch leading to a leaf of the species tree is also identifiable for any species from which more than one gene is sampled.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:36.721000

The time complexity of TnT is linear to the number of nodes in the graph, and it can construct decision graphs on large datasets.

The most common impurity measures are Shannon entropy and Gini impurity. These impurity measures are insensitive to the order of training data and hence the final tree obtained is invariant to any permutation of the data. This is a limitation in terms of modeling when there are temporal order dependencies between data instances. In this research, we propose the adoption of Effort-To-Compress (ETC) - a complexity measure, for the first time, as an alternative impurity measure. Unlike Shannon entropy and Gini impurity, structural impurity based on ETC is able to capture order dependencies in the data, thus obtaining potentially different decision trees for different permutations of the same data instances, a concept we term as Permutation Decision Trees (PDT). We then introduce the notion of Permutation Bagging achieved using permutation decision trees without the need for random feature selection and sub-sampling. We conduct a performance comparison between Permutation Decision Trees and classical decision trees across various real-world datasets, including Appendicitis, Breast Cancer Wisconsin, Diabetes Pima Indian, Ionosphere, Iris, Sonar, and Wine. Our findings reveal that PDT demonstrates comparable performance to classical decision trees across most datasets. Remarkably, in certain instances, PDT even slightly surpasses the performance of classical decision trees. In comparing Permutation Bagging with Random Forest, we attain comparable performance to Random Forest models consisting of 50 to 1000 trees, using merely 21 trees. This highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of Permutation Bagging in achieving comparable performance outcomes with significantly fewer trees.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:36.728000

Long decision paths often cause overfitting problems, and make models difficult to interpret. With longer decision paths, inference is also more likely to fail when the data contain missing values. In this work, we propose a new tree model called Cascading Decision Trees to alleviate this problem.

We demonstrate how easy and versatile they are to use on a host of different applications. For example, we show how to maintain the diameter, center, and median of each tree in the forest. The forest can be updated by insertion and deletion of edges and by changes to vertex and edge weights. Each update is supported in O(log n) time, where n is the size of the tree(s) involved in the update. Also, we show how to support nearest common ancestor queries and level ancestor queries with respect to arbitrary roots in O(log n) time. Finally, with marked and unmarked vertices, we show how to compute distances to a nearest marked vertex. The later has applications to approximate nearest marked vertex in general graphs, and thereby to static optimization problems over shortest path metrics.
  Technically speaking, top trees are easily implemented either with Frederickson's topology trees [Ambivalent Data Structures for Dynamic 2-Edge-Connectivity and k Smallest Spanning Trees, SIAM J. Comput. 26 (2) pp. 484-538, 1997] or with Sleator and Tarjan's dynamic trees [A Data Structure for Dynamic Trees. J. Comput. Syst. Sc. 26 (3) pp. 362-391, 1983].

Motivated by this, our algorithm uses a strategy to assess the hyperplanes in such a way that the geometric structure in the data is taken into account.

While existing techniques can learn verifiable decision tree policies there is no guarantee that the learners generate a decision that performs optimally. In this work, we study the optimization of size-limited decision trees for Markov Decision Processes (MPDs) and propose OMDTs: Optimal MDP Decision Trees. Given a user-defined size limit and MDP formulation OMDT directly maximizes the expected discounted return for the decision tree using Mixed-Integer Linear Programming. By training optimal decision tree policies for different MDPs we empirically study the optimality gap for existing imitation learning techniques and find that they perform sub-optimally. We show that this is due to an inherent shortcoming of imitation learning, namely that complex policies cannot be represented using size-limited trees. In such cases, it is better to directly optimize the tree for expected return. While there is generally a trade-off between the performance and interpretability of machine learning models, we find that OMDTs limited to a depth of 3 often perform close to the optimal limit.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:36.747000

For a given $f$, a fundamental goal is to minimize the depth and/or the size of the decision tree computing it.
  In this paper, we extend the decision tree model to the world of hazard-free computation. We allow each query to produce three results: zero, one, or unknown. The output could also be: zero, one, or unknown, with the constraint that we should output ""unknown"" only when we cannot determine the answer from the input bits. This setting naturally gives rise to ternary decision trees computing functions, which we call hazard-free decision trees. We prove various lower and upper bounds on the depth and size of hazard-free decision trees and compare them to their Boolean counterparts. We prove optimal separations and relate hazard-free decision tree parameters to well-known Boolean function parameters. We show that the analogues of sensitivity, block sensitivity, and certificate complexity for hazard-free functions are all polynomially equivalent to each other and to hazard-free decision tree depth. i.e., we prove the sensitivity theorem in the hazard-free model. We then prove that hazard-free sensitivity satisfies an interesting structural property that is known to hold in the Boolean world.

The interpretability of decision trees motivates explainability approaches by so-called intrinsic interpretability, and it is at the core of recent proposals for applying interpretable ML models in high-risk applications. The belief in DT interpretability is justified by the fact that explanations for DT predictions are generally expected to be succinct. Indeed, in the case of DTs, explanations correspond to DT paths. Since decision trees are ideally shallow, and so paths contain far fewer features than the total number of features, explanations in DTs are expected to be succinct, and hence interpretable. This paper offers both theoretical and experimental arguments demonstrating that, as long as interpretability of decision trees equates with succinctness of explanations, then decision trees ought not be deemed interpretable. The paper introduces logically rigorous path explanations and path explanation redundancy, and proves that there exist functions for which decision trees must exhibit paths with arbitrarily large explanation redundancy. The paper also proves that only a very restricted class of functions can be represented with DTs that exhibit no explanation redundancy. In addition, the paper includes experimental results substantiating that path explanation redundancy is observed ubiquitously in decision trees, including those obtained using different tree learning algorithms, but also in a wide range of publicly available decision trees. The paper also proposes polynomial-time algorithms for eliminating path explanation redundancy, which in practice require negligible time to compute.

Our algorithm operates at a coarse-grain level, using atomic pairwise interactions in a way akin to recent population protocol models. The algorithm relies on a perpetual alternation of \emph{topology-induced splittings} and \emph{computation-induced mergings} of a forest of spanning trees. Each tree in the forest hosts exactly one token (also called root) that performs a random walk {\em inside} the tree, switching parent-child relationships as it crosses edges. When two tokens are located on both sides of a same edge, their trees are merged upon this edge and one token disappears. Whenever an edge that belongs to a tree disappears, its child endpoint regenerates a new token instantly.

Using our representation, we show that decision trees are surprisingly robust to test-time missingness of feature values; we address predictive equivalence's impact on quantifying variable importance; and we present an algorithm to optimize the cost of reaching predictions.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:36.803000

While explicit MPC and neural network approximations mitigate this burden, they suffer from scalability issues or lack interpretability, limiting their applicability in safety-critical systems. This work introduces a data-driven framework that directly learns the Linear MPC control law from sampled state-action pairs using Oblique Decision Trees with Linear Predictions (ODT-LP), achieving both computational efficiency and interpretability. By leveraging the piecewise affine structure of Linear MPC, we prove that the Linear MPC control law can be replicated by finite-depth ODT-LP models. We develop a gradient-based training algorithm using smooth approximations of tree routing functions to learn this structure from grid-sampled Linear MPC solutions, enabling end-to-end optimization. Input-to-state stability is established under bounded approximation errors, with explicit error decomposition into learning inaccuracies and sampling errors to inform model design. Numerical experiments demonstrate that ODT-LP controllers match MPC's closed-loop performance while reducing online evaluation time by orders of magnitude compared to MPC, explicit MPC, neural network, and random forest counterparts. The transparent tree structure enables formal verification of control logic, bridging the gap between computational efficiency and certifiable reliability for safety-critical systems.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:36.805000

  As a consequence, many existing optimization algorithms for both SVMs and Lasso can also be applied to the respective other problem instances. Also, the equivalence allows for many known theoretical insights for SVM and Lasso to be translated between the two settings. One such implication gives a simple kernelized version of the Lasso, analogous to the kernels used in the SVM setting. Another consequence is that the sparsity of a Lasso solution is equal to the number of support vectors for the corresponding SVM instance, and that one can use screening rules to prune the set of support vectors. Furthermore, we can relate sublinear time algorithms for the two problems, and give a new such algorithm variant for the Lasso.

The relevance of features in a classification procedure is linked to the fact that misclassifications costs are frequently asymmetric, since false positive and false negative cases may have very different consequences. However, off-the-shelf Feature Selection procedures seldom take into account such cost-sensitivity of errors.
  In this paper we propose a mathematical-optimization-based Feature Selection procedure embedded in one of the most popular classification procedures, namely, Support Vector Machines, accommodating asymmetric misclassification costs. The key idea is to replace the traditional margin maximization by minimizing the number of features selected, but imposing upper bounds on the false positive and negative rates. The problem is written as an integer linear problem plus a quadratic convex problem for Support Vector Machines with both linear and radial kernels.

Previous studies show that One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) can outperform two-class classifiers for within-project defect prediction, however it is not effective when employed at a finer granularity (i.e., commit-level defect prediction). In this paper, we further investigate whether learning from one class only is sufficient to produce effective defect prediction model in two other different scenarios (i.e., granularity), namely cross-version and cross-project defect prediction models, as well as replicate the previous work at within-project granularity for completeness. Our empirical results confirm that OCSVM performance remain low at different granularity levels, that is, it is outperformed by the two-class Random Forest (RF) classifier for both cross-version and cross-project defect prediction. While, we cannot conclude that OCSVM is the best classifier, our results still show interesting findings. While OCSVM does not outperform RF, it still achieves performance superior to its two-class counterpart (i.e., SVM) as well as other two-class classifiers studied herein. We also observe that OCSVM is more suitable for both cross-version and cross-project defect prediction, rather than for within-project defect prediction, thus suggesting it performs better with heterogeneous data.

However, this assumption does not generally hold in security-sensitive settings. As we demonstrate, an intelligent adversary can, to some extent, predict the change of the SVM's decision function due to malicious input and use this ability to construct malicious data. The proposed attack uses a gradient ascent strategy in which the gradient is computed based on properties of the SVM's optimal solution.

Woods, Virtue Ene Agada, Adebola K. Ojo",2025,"Phishing is a semantic attack which targets the user rather than the computer. It is a new Internet crime in comparison with other forms such as virus and hacking. Considering the damage phishing websites has caused to various economies by collapsing organizations, stealing information and financial diversion, various researchers have embarked on different ways of detecting phishing websites but there has been no agreement about the best algorithm to be used for prediction. This study is interested in integrating the strengths of two algorithms, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multi-Class Classification Rules based on Association Rules (MCAR) to establish a strong and better means of predicting phishing websites. A total of 11,056 websites were used from both PhishTank and yahoo directory to verify the effectiveness of this approach. Feature extraction and rules generation were done by the MCAR technique; classification and prediction were done by SVM technique. The result showed that the technique achieved 98.30% classification accuracy with a computation time of 2205.33s with minimum error rate. It showed a total of 98% Area under the Curve (AUC) which showed the proportion of accuracy in classifying phishing websites. The model showed 82.84% variance in the prediction of phishing websites based on the coefficient of determination. The use of two techniques together in detecting phishing websites produced a more accurate result as it combined the strength of both techniques respectively.

The network dilution measures the fraction of neuron couples that are connected, and the network asymmetry measures to what extent the underlying connectivity matrix is asymmetric. For each given neural network, we study the dynamical evolution of all the different initial conditions, thus characterizing the full dynamical landscape without imposing any learning rule. Because of the deterministic dynamics, each trajectory converges to an attractor, that can be either a fixed point or a limit cycle. These attractors form the set of all the possible limit behaviors of the neural network. For each network, we then determine the convergence times, the limit cycles' length, the number of attractors, and the sizes of the attractors' basin. We show that there are two network structures that maximize the number of possible limit behaviors. The first optimal network structure is fully-connected and symmetric. On the contrary, the second optimal network structure is highly sparse and asymmetric. The latter optimal is similar to what observed in different biological neuronal circuits. These observations lead us to hypothesize that independently from any given learning model, an efficient and effective biologic network that stores a number of limit behaviors close to its maximum capacity tends to develop a connectivity structure similar to one of the optimal networks we found.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:41.306000

We initiate the study of rigorously characterizing the sample-complexity of estimating CNNs and RNNs. We show that the sample-complexity to learn CNNs and RNNs scales linearly with their intrinsic dimension and this sample-complexity is much smaller than for their FNN counterparts. For both CNNs and RNNs, we also present lower bounds showing our sample complexities are tight up to logarithmic factors.

Hilgetag",2010,"An essential requirement for the representation of functional patterns in complex neural networks, such as the mammalian cerebral cortex, is the existence of stable regimes of network activation, typically arising from a limited parameter range. In this range of limited sustained activity (LSA), the activity of neural populations in the network persists between the extremes of either quickly dying out or activating the whole network. Hierarchical modular networks were previously found to show a wider parameter range for LSA than random or small-world networks not possessing hierarchical organization or multiple modules. Here we explored how variation in the number of hierarchical levels and modules per level influenced network dynamics and occurrence of LSA. We tested hierarchical configurations of different network sizes, approximating the large-scale networks linking cortical columns in one hemisphere of the rat, cat, or macaque monkey brain. Scaling of the network size affected the number of hierarchical levels and modules in the optimal networks, also depending on whether global edge density or the numbers of connections per node were kept constant. For constant edge density, only few network configurations, possessing an intermediate number of levels and a large number of modules, led to a large range of LSA independent of brain size. For a constant number of node connections, there was a trend for optimal configurations in larger-size networks to possess a larger number of hierarchical levels or more modules. These results may help to explain the trend to greater network complexity apparent in larger brains and may indicate that this complexity is required for maintaining stable levels of neural activation.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:41.335000

We aim to address both shortcomings with a class of recurrent networks that use a stochastic state transition mechanism between cell applications.

Here we study the interrelation between the self-sustained activity in autonomously active recurrent neural nets and external sensory stimuli.
  There is no a priori semantical relation between the influx of external stimuli and the patterns generated internally by the autonomous and ongoing brain dynamics. The question then arises when and how are semantic correlations between internal and external dynamical processes learned and built up?
  We study this problem within the paradigm of transient state dynamics for the neural activity in recurrent neural nets, i.e. for an autonomous neural activity characterized by an infinite time-series of transiently stable attractor states. We propose that external stimuli will be relevant during the sensitive periods, {\it viz} the transition period between one transient state and the subsequent semi-stable attractor. A diffusive learning signal is generated unsupervised whenever the stimulus influences the internal dynamics qualitatively.
  For testing we have presented to the model system stimuli corresponding to the bars and stripes problem.

In this paper, we propose two constraints that make RTRL scalable. We show that by either decomposing the network into independent modules or learning the network in stages, we can make RTRL scale linearly with the number of parameters. Unlike prior scalable gradient estimation algorithms, such as UORO and Truncated-BPTT, our algorithms do not add noise or bias to the gradient estimate.

We develop a new method of scaling up physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve arbitrary high-dimensional PDEs.

Accurately capturing the list of medications currently taken by a given patient is extremely challenging due to undefined errors and omissions. We present a general robust framework that explicitly models the possible contamination through overtime decay mechanism on the input billing codes and noise injection into the recurrent hidden states, respectively. By doing this, billing codes are reformulated into its temporal patterns with decay rates on each medical variable, and the hidden states of RNNs are regularised by random noises which serve as dropout to improved RNNs robustness towards data variability in terms of missing values and multiple errors.

However, generating candidate chemical compounds for solar cells is a time-consuming process requiring thousands of hours of laboratory analysis. For a solar cell, the most important property is the power conversion efficiency which is dependent on the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) values of the donor molecules. Recently, machine learning techniques have proved to be very useful in building predictive models for HOMO values of donor structures of Organic Photovoltaic Cells (OPVs). Since experimental datasets are limited in size, current machine learning models are trained on data derived from calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Molecular line notations such as SMILES or InChI are popular input representations for describing the molecular structure of donor molecules. The two types of line representations encode different information, such as SMILES defines the bond types while InChi defines protonation. In this work, we present an ensemble deep neural network architecture, called SINet, which harnesses both the SMILES and InChI molecular representations to predict HOMO values and leverage the potential of transfer learning from a sizeable DFT-computed dataset- Harvard CEP to build more robust predictive models for relatively smaller HOPV datasets.

For deep convolutional neural networks, dropout is known to work well in fully-connected layers. However, its effect in convolutional and pooling layers is still not clear. This paper demonstrates that max-pooling dropout is equivalent to randomly picking activation based on a multinomial distribution at training time. In light of this insight, we advocate employing our proposed probabilistic weighted pooling, instead of commonly used max-pooling, to act as model averaging at test time. Empirical evidence validates the superiority of probabilistic weighted pooling. We also empirically show that the effect of convolutional dropout is not trivial, despite the dramatically reduced possibility of over-fitting due to the convolutional architecture. Elaborately designing dropout training simultaneously in max-pooling and fully-connected layers, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on MNIST, and very competitive results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, relative to other approaches without data augmentation.

Approaches based on Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DANN) are very popular in our days. Depending on the learning task, the exact form of DANNs is determined via their multi-layer architecture, activation functions and the so-called loss function. However, for a majority of deep learning approaches based on DANNs, the kernel structure of neural signal processing remains the same, where the node response is encoded as a linear superposition of neural activity, while the non-linearity is triggered by the activation functions. In the current paper, we suggest to analyze the neural signal processing in DANNs from the point of view of homogeneous chaos theory as known from polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). From the PCE perspective, the (linear) response on each node of a DANN could be seen as a $1^{st}$ degree multi-variate polynomial of single neurons from the previous layer, i.e. linear weighted sum of monomials. From this point of view, the conventional DANN structure relies implicitly (but erroneously) on a Gaussian distribution of neural signals. Additionally, this view revels that by design DANNs do not necessarily fulfill any orthogonality or orthonormality condition for a majority of data-driven applications. Therefore, the prevailing handling of neural signals in DANNs could lead to redundant representation as any neural signal could contain some partial information from other neural signals. To tackle that challenge, we suggest to employ the data-driven generalization of PCE theory known as arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC) to construct a corresponding multi-variate orthonormal representations on each node of a DANN to obtain Deep arbitrary polynomial chaos neural networks.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:45.104000

To address this challenge, we propose a modification of the radial basis function neural network model by equipping its Gaussian kernel with a learnable precision matrix. We show that precious information is contained in the spectrum of the precision matrix that can be extracted once the training of the model is completed. In particular, the eigenvectors explain the directions of maximum sensitivity of the model revealing the active subspace and suggesting potential applications for supervised dimensionality reduction. At the same time, the eigenvectors highlight the relationship in terms of absolute variation between the input and the latent variables, thereby allowing us to extract a ranking of the input variables based on their importance to the prediction task enhancing the model interpretability.

While transfer learning assumes that the learning process for a target task will benefit from re-using representations learned for another task, anti-transfer avoids the learning of representations that have been learned for an orthogonal task, i.e., one that is not relevant and potentially misleading for the target task, such as speaker identity for speech recognition or speech content for emotion recognition. In anti-transfer learning, we penalize similarity between activations of a network being trained and another one previously trained on an orthogonal task, which yields more suitable representations. This leads to better generalization and provides a degree of control over correlations that are spurious or undesirable, e.g. to avoid social bias. We have implemented anti-transfer for convolutional neural networks in different configurations with several similarity metrics and aggregation functions, which we evaluate and analyze with several speech and audio tasks and settings, using six datasets. We show that anti-transfer actually leads to the intended invariance to the orthogonal task and to more appropriate features for the target task at hand. Anti-transfer learning consistently improves classification accuracy in all test cases. While anti-transfer creates computation and memory cost at training time, there is relatively little computation cost when using pre-trained models for orthogonal tasks. Anti-transfer is widely applicable and particularly useful where a specific invariance is desirable or where trained models are available and labeled data for orthogonal tasks are difficult to obtain.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:45.141000

Also, it is observed that success rates obtained with DNNs are higher than those obtained with traditional neural networks. In addition, one of the advantages of DNNs is that there is no need to spend an extra effort to determine the features; the CNN automatically extracts the features from the dataset during the training. Besides their benefits, the DNNs have the following three major drawbacks among the others: (i) Researchers have struggled with over-fitting and under-fitting issues in the training of DNNs, (ii) determination of even a coarse structure for the DNN may take days, and (iii) most of the time, the proposed network structure is too large to be too bulky to be used in real time applications.

However, not all the windows contribute equally to the prediction results of CNNs. In practice, the convolutional operation on some of the windows (e.g., smooth windows that contain very similar pixels) can be very redundant and may introduce noises into the computation. Such redundancy may not only deteriorate the performance but also incur the unnecessary computational cost. Thus, it is important to reduce the computational redundancy of convolution to improve the performance. To this end, we propose a Content-aware Convolution (CAC) that automatically detects the smooth windows and applies a 1x1 convolutional kernel to replace the original large kernel. In this sense, we are able to effectively avoid the redundant computation on similar pixels. By replacing the standard convolution in CNNs with our CAC, the resultant models yield significantly better performance and lower computational cost than the baseline models with the standard convolution.

Lexical learning is modeled as emergent from an architecture that forces a deep neural network to output data such that unique information is retrievable from its acoustic outputs. The networks trained on lexical items from TIMIT learn to encode unique information corresponding to lexical items in the form of categorical variables in their latent space. By manipulating these variables, the network outputs specific lexical items. The network occasionally outputs innovative lexical items that violate training data, but are linguistically interpretable and highly informative for cognitive modeling and neural network interpretability. Innovative outputs suggest that phonetic and phonological representations learned by the network can be productively recombined and directly paralleled to productivity in human speech: a fiwGAN network trained on `suit' and `dark' outputs innovative `start', even though it never saw `start' or even a [st] sequence in the training data.

Geiger,2020,"We review the current literature concerned with information plane analyses of neural network classifiers. While the underlying information bottleneck theory and the claim that information-theoretic compression is causally linked to generalization are plausible, empirical evidence was found to be both supporting and conflicting. We review this evidence together with a detailed analysis of how the respective information quantities were estimated. Our survey suggests that compression visualized in information planes is not necessarily information-theoretic, but is rather often compatible with geometric compression of the latent representations. This insight gives the information plane a renewed justification.
  Aside from this, we shed light on the problem of estimating mutual information in deterministic neural networks and its consequences. Specifically, we argue that even in feed-forward neural networks the data processing inequality need not hold for estimates of mutual information. Similarly, while a fitting phase, in which the mutual information between the latent representation and the target increases, is necessary (but not sufficient) for good classification performance, depending on the specifics of mutual information estimation such a fitting phase need not be visible in the information plane.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:45.166000

Since time delay is ubiquitous in most physical and biological systems, more attention is being made for the delayed neural networks. The inclusion of time delay into a neural model is natural due to the finite transmission time of the interactions. The stability analysis of the neural networks depends on the Lyapunov function and hence it must be constructed for the given system.

We analyze the connection between these information-theoretic quantities and classification performance on the test set by cumulatively ablating neurons in networks trained on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10. Our results parallel those recently published by Morcos et al., indicating that class selectivity is not a good indicator for classification performance. However, looking at individual layers separately, both mutual information and class selectivity are positively correlated with classification performance, at least for networks with ReLU activation functions. We provide explanations for this phenomenon and conclude that it is ill-advised to compare the proposed information-theoretic quantities across layers. Furthermore, we show that cumulative ablation of neurons with ascending or descending information-theoretic quantities can be used to formulate hypotheses regarding the joint behavior of multiple neurons, such as redundancy and synergy, with comparably low computational cost.

Unfortunately, the same architectures perform much worse when they have to compare parts of an image to each other to correctly classify this image.
  Until now, no well-formed theoretical argument has been presented to explain this deficiency. In this paper, we will argue that convolutional layers are of little use for such problems, since comparison tasks are global by nature, but convolutional layers are local by design. We will use this insight to reformulate a comparison task into a sorting task and use findings on sorting networks to propose a lower bound for the number of parameters a neural network needs to solve comparison tasks in a generalizable way.

In this work, we present a Newton--Puiseux framework that examines the \emph{local decision geometry} of a trained CVNN by (i) fitting a small, kink-aware polynomial surrogate to the \emph{logit difference} in the vicinity of uncertain inputs, and (ii) factorizing this surrogate using Newton--Puiseux expansions to derive analytic branch descriptors, including exponents, multiplicities, and orientations. These descriptors provide phase-aligned directions that induce class flips in the original network and allow for a straightforward, \emph{multiplicity-guided} temperature adjustment for improved calibration. We outline assumptions and diagnostic measures under which the surrogate proves informative and characterize potential failure modes arising from piecewise-holomorphic activations (e.g., modReLU).

Once the low scoring filters are pruned away the remainder of the network is fine tuned and is shown to give performance comparable to the original unpruned network. In this work, we report experiments which suggest that the comparable performance of the pruned network is not due to the specific criterion chosen but due to the inherent plasticity of deep neural networks which allows them to recover from the loss of pruned filters once the rest of the filters are fine-tuned. Specifically we show counter-intuitive results wherein by randomly pruning 25-50% filters from deep CNNs we are able to obtain the same performance as obtained by using state-of-the-art pruning methods. We empirically validate our claims by doing an exhaustive evaluation with VGG-16 and ResNet-50. We also evaluate a real world scenario where a CNN trained on all 1000 ImageNet classes needs to be tested on only a small set of classes at test time (say, only animals). We create a new benchmark dataset from ImageNet to evaluate such class specific pruning and show that even here a random pruning strategy gives close to state-of-the-art performance. Unlike existing approaches which mainly focus on the task of image classification, in this work we also report results on object detection and image segmentation. We show that using a simple random pruning strategy we can achieve significant speed up in object detection (74% improvement in fps) while retaining the same accuracy as that of the original Faster RCNN model.

These networks are composed of layers of connected units called artificial neurons, loosely modeling the neurons in a biological brain. However, their implementation on conventional hardware (CPU/GPU) results in high power consumption, making their integration on embedded systems difficult. In a car for example, embedded algorithms have very high constraints in term of energy, latency and accuracy. To design more efficient computer vision algorithms, we propose to follow an end-to-end biologically inspired approach using event cameras and spiking neural networks (SNNs). Event cameras output asynchronous and sparse events, providing an incredibly efficient data source, but processing these events with synchronous and dense algorithms such as CNNs does not yield any significant benefits. To address this limitation, we use spiking neural networks (SNNs), which are more biologically realistic neural networks where units communicate using discrete spikes. Due to the nature of their operations, they are hardware friendly and energy-efficient, but training them still remains a challenge. Our method enables the training of sparse spiking convolutional neural networks directly on event data, using the popular deep learning framework PyTorch.

A solution to both issues is transfer learning, but it comes with its own challenge, i.e., substantial data distribution shifts between datasets, subjects and even between subsequent sessions of the same subject. Approach. For every pair of pre-training (donor) and test (receiver) dataset, we first train a model on the donor before training merely an additional new linear classification layer based on a few receiver trials. Performance of this transfer approach is then tested on other trials of the receiver dataset. Significance. First, we lower the threshold to use transfer learning between motor imagery datasets: the overall framework is extremely simple and nevertheless obtains decent classification scores. Second, we demonstrate that deep learning models are a good option for motor imagery cross-dataset transfer both for the reasons outlined in the first point and because the framework presented is viable in online scenarios. Finally, analysing which datasets are best suited for transfer learning can be used as a reference for future researchers to determine which to use for pre-training or benchmarking.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:48.504000

A core issue in transfer learning is to learn a shared feature space in where the distributions of the data from two domains are matched. This learning process can be named as transfer representation learning (TRL). The feature transformation methods are crucial to ensure the success of TRL. The most commonly used feature transformation method in TRL is kernel-based nonlinear mapping to the high-dimensional space followed by linear dimensionality reduction. But the kernel functions are lack of interpretability and are difficult to be selected. To this end, the TSK fuzzy system (TSK-FS) is combined with transfer learning and a more intuitive and interpretable modeling method, called transfer representation learning with TSK-FS (TRL-TSK-FS) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, TRL-TSK-FS realizes TRL from two aspects. On one hand, the data in the source and target domains are transformed into the fuzzy feature space in which the distribution distance of the data between two domains is min-imized. On the other hand, discriminant information and geo-metric properties of the data are preserved by linear discriminant analysis and principal component analysis. In addition, another advantage arises with the proposed method, that is, the nonlinear transformation is realized by constructing fuzzy mapping with the antecedent part of the TSK-FS instead of kernel functions which are difficult to be selected.

Academic scientists are those employed in academia and public research organizations whereas non-academic scientists are those with a scientific background employed in other sectors.

Therefore, computational emotion models are usually grounded in the agent's decision making architecture, of which RL is an important subclass. Studying emotions in RL-based agents is useful for three research fields. For machine learning (ML) researchers, emotion models may improve learning efficiency. For the interactive ML and human-robot interaction (HRI) community, emotions can communicate state and enhance user investment. Lastly, it allows affective modelling (AM) researchers to investigate their emotion theories in a successful AI agent class. This survey provides background on emotion theory and RL. It systematically addresses 1) from what underlying dimensions (e.g., homeostasis, appraisal) emotions can be derived and how these can be modelled in RL-agents, 2) what types of emotions have been derived from these dimensions, and 3) how these emotions may either influence the learning efficiency of the agent or be useful as social signals.

In this work, we study the landscape through the lens of the loss Hessian, with a focus on its largest eigenvalue (i.e. the sharpness), and find that certain spectral properties under $μ$P are largely independent of the size of the network, and remain consistent as training progresses.

Our measure, the Log Expected Empirical Prediction (LEEP), is simple and easy to compute: when given a classifier trained on a source data set, it only requires running the target data set through this classifier once. We analyze the properties of LEEP theoretically and demonstrate its effectiveness empirically. Our analysis shows that LEEP can predict the performance and convergence speed of both transfer and meta-transfer learning methods, even for small or imbalanced data. Moreover, LEEP outperforms recently proposed transferability measures such as negative conditional entropy and H scores. Notably, when transferring from ImageNet to CIFAR100, LEEP can achieve up to 30% improvement compared to the best competing method in terms of the correlations with actual transfer accuracy.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:48.593000

However, the majority of these proposals primarily focus on balanced datasets, neglecting the inherent data imbalance present in real-world scenarios. Consequently, there is a pressing need for approaches that not only address the data imbalance but also prioritize precise classification of brain cancer. In this work, we present a novel deep learning-based approach, called Transfer Learning-CNN, for brain tumor classification using MRI data. The proposed model leverages the predictive capabilities of existing publicly available models by utilizing their pre-trained weights and transferring those weights to the CNN. By leveraging a publicly available Brain MRI dataset, the experiment evaluated various transfer learning models for classifying different tumor types, including meningioma, glioma, and pituitary tumors. We investigate the impact of different loss functions, including focal loss, and oversampling methods, such as SMOTE and ADASYN, in addressing the data imbalance issue.

Shaft power is the mechanical power transmitted from the engine to the shaft and directly impacts fuel consumption, making its accurate prediction a paramount step in optimizing vessel performance. Power consumption is highly correlated with ship parameters such as speed and shaft rotation per minute, as well as weather and sea conditions. Frequent access to this operational data can improve prediction accuracy. However, obtaining high-quality sensor data is often infeasible and costly, making alternative sources such as noon reports a viable option. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based approach for predicting vessels shaft power, where a model is initially trained on high-frequency data from a vessel and then fine-tuned with low-frequency daily noon reports from other vessels. We tested our approach on sister vessels (identical dimensions and configurations), a similar vessel (slightly larger with a different engine), and a different vessel (distinct dimensions and configurations). The experiments showed that the mean absolute percentage error decreased by 10.6 percent for sister vessels, 3.6 percent for a similar vessel, and 5.3 percent for a different vessel, compared to the model trained solely on noon report data.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:48.600000

This study investigates how LLMs, specifically OpenAI's GPT-4 and Microsoft Copilot, can reinforce gender and racial stereotypes within the software engineering (SE) profession through both textual and graphical outputs. We used each LLM to generate 300 profiles, consisting of 100 gender-based and 50 gender-neutral profiles, for a recruitment scenario in SE roles. Recommendations were generated for each profile and evaluated against the job requirements for four distinct SE positions. Each LLM was asked to select the top 5 candidates and subsequently the best candidate for each role. Each LLM was also asked to generate images for the top 5 candidates, providing a dataset for analysing potential biases in both text-based selections and visual representations. Our analysis reveals that both models preferred male and Caucasian profiles, particularly for senior roles, and favoured images featuring traits such as lighter skin tones, slimmer body types, and younger appearances. These findings highlight underlying societal biases influence the outputs of LLMs, contributing to narrow, exclusionary stereotypes that can further limit diversity and perpetuate inequities in the SE field.

Unfortunately, the existing filtering methods have not kept up with the growth of existing data sources, such as GitHub, and researchers often rely on quick and dirty techniques to curate datasets.
  Objective: The objective of this study is to develop a method capable of filtering large quantities of software projects in a resource-efficient way.
  Method: This study follows the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology. The proposed method, PHANTOM, extracts five measures from Git logs. Each measure is transformed into a time-series, which is represented as a feature vector for clustering using the k-means algorithm.
  Results: Using the ground truth from a previous study, PHANTOM was shown to be able to rediscover the ground truth on the training dataset, and was able to identify ""engineered"" projects with up to 0.87 Precision and 0.94 Recall on the validation dataset. PHANTOM downloaded and processed the metadata of 1,786,601 GitHub repositories in 21.5 days using a single personal computer, which is over 33% faster than the previous study which used a computer cluster of 200 nodes. The possibility of applying the method outside of the open-source community was investigated by curating 100 repositories owned by two companies.
  Conclusions: It is possible to use an unsupervised approach to identify engineered projects. PHANTOM was shown to be competitive compared to the existing supervised approaches while reducing the hardware requirements by two orders of magnitude.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:53.143000

Strategies to gather, analyze, and negotiate requirements are complemented by efforts to manage customer input after products have been deployed. For the latter, support tickets are key in allowing customers to submit their issues, bug reports, and feature requests. If insufficient attention is given to support issues, however, their escalation to management becomes time-consuming and expensive, especially for large organizations managing hundreds of customers and thousands of support tickets. Our work provides a step towards simplifying the job of support analysts and managers, particularly in predicting the risk of escalating support tickets. In a field study at our large industrial partner, IBM, we used a design science research methodology to characterize the support process and data available to IBM analysts in managing escalations. We then implemented these features into a machine learning model to predict support ticket escalations. We trained and evaluated our machine learning model on over 2.5 million support tickets and 10,000 escalations, obtaining a recall of 87.36% and an 88.23% reduction in the workload for support analysts looking to identify support tickets at risk of escalation. Finally, in addition to these research evaluation activities, we compared the performance of our support ticket model with that of a model developed with no feature engineering; the support ticket model features outperformed the non-engineered model. The artifacts created in this research are designed to serve as a starting place for organizations interested in predicting support ticket escalations, and for future researchers to build on to advance research in escalation prediction.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:53.150000

Through qualitative analysis, we discovered that the Creator of the feature (i.e., AI or human) significantly influences users' feature selection, and the semantic clarity of the suggested feature greatly impacts its adoption rate. Furthermore, our findings indicate that users perceive both differences and complementarity between features generated by humans and those generated by AI.

Despite the surging research interest in BCSA, it is significantly challenging to perform new research in this field for several reasons. First, most existing approaches focus only on the end results, namely, increasing the success rate of BCSA, by adopting uninterpretable machine learning. Moreover, they utilize their own benchmark, sharing neither the source code nor the entire dataset. Finally, researchers often use different terminologies or even use the same technique without citing the previous literature properly, which makes it difficult to reproduce or extend previous work. To address these problems, we take a step back from the mainstream and contemplate fundamental research questions for BCSA.

With this paper, we want to characterize research software as a new application domain that needs attention from the Requirements Engineering community. We conducted an exploratory study based on 8 interviews with 12 researchers who develop software. We describe how researchers elicit, document, and analyze requirements for research software and what processes they follow. From this, we derive specific challenges and describe a vision of Requirements Engineering for research software.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:53.199000

To address these problems, this paper synthesizes existing knowledge of sampling into a succinct primer and proposes extensive guidelines for improving the conduct, presentation and evaluation of sampling in software engineering research.

Normally, analyses with high computational effort are conducted on high-resolution finite element meshes to optimize parts with good global and local stability. Until recently, works focused only on either global or local buckling behavior. We use two-scale optimization based on asymptotic homogenization of elastic properties and local buckling behavior to reduce the effort of full-scale analyses.

The sensitivity information can greatly reduce the computational cost of traversing high-dimensional and discrete design spaces in comparison to employing gradient-free optimization methods.

First, we reformulate NMF as minimizing a concave function over a product of convex cones--one approach is based on the exponential cone, and the other on the second-order cone. Then, we solve these reformulations iteratively: at each step, we minimize exactly, over the feasible set, a majorization of the objective functions obtained via linearization at the current iterate. Hence these subproblems are convex conic programs and can be solved efficiently using dedicated algorithms. We prove that our approaches reach a stationary point with an accuracy decreasing as $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{i})$, where $i$ denotes the iteration number. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis is the first to provide a convergence rate to stationary points for NMF. Furthermore, in the particular cases of rank-one factorizations (that is, $K=1$), we show that one of our formulations can be expressed as a convex optimization problem implying that optimal rank-one approximations can be computed efficiently.

The localization principle unifies, generalizes and sharpens most of the known results on existence of global saddle points, and, in essence, reduces the problem of the existence of saddle points to a local analysis of optimality conditions. With the use of the localization principle we obtain first necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a global saddle point of an augmented Lagrangian for cone constrained minimax problems via both second and first order optimality conditions.

These globally exact augmented Lagrangians can be utilized in order to design new superlinearly (or even quadratically) convergent optimization methods for cone constrained optimization problems.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:53.493000

The least Frobenius norm updating quadratic interpolation model function is one of the essential under-determined model functions for model-based derivative-free trust-region methods. This article proposes derivative-free optimization with transformed objective functions and gives a trust-region method with the least Frobenius norm model. The model updating formula is based on Powell's formula. The method shares the same framework with those for problems without transformations, and its query scheme is given. We propose the definitions related to optimality-preserving transformations to understand the interpolation model in our method. We prove the existence of model optimality-preserving transformations beyond translation transformation. The necessary and sufficient condition for such transformations is given. The affine transformation with a positive multiplication coefficient is not model optimality-preserving. We also analyze the corresponding least Frobenius norm updating model and its interpolation error when the objective function is affinely transformed. Convergence property of a provable algorithmic framework containing our model is given. Numerical results of solving test problems and a real-world problem with the implementation NEWUOA-Trans show that our method can successfully solve most problems with objective optimality-preserving transformations, even though such transformations will change the optimality of the model function.

If Lagrange multipliers exist, exact penalty methods ensure that the penalty parameter only need increase a finite number of times, but are typically scorned in smooth optimization for the penalized problems are not smooth. This led researchers to consider the implementation of exact penalty methods inconvenient. Recent advances in proximal methods have led to increasingly efficient solvers for nonsmooth optimization. We study a general exact penalty algorithm and use it to show that the exact $\ell_2$-penalty method for equality-constrained optimization can, in fact, be implemented efficiently by solving the penalized problem using a proximal-type algorithm. We study the convergence of our algorithm and establish a worst-case complexity bound of $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-2})$ to bring a stationarity measure below $ε> 0$ under the Mangarasian-Fromowitz constraint qualification and Lipschitz continuity of the objective gradient and constraint Jacobian. While the Lipschitz continuity of the objective gradient is not required for convergence in view of recent works, it is used in our analysis to derive the complexity bound. In a degenerate scenario where the penalty parameter grows unbounded, the complexity becomes $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-8})$, which is worse than another bound found in the literature.

The model couples a non-local and viscous Cahn-Hilliard equation for the phase parameter with a reaction-diffusion equation for the nutrient. The optimal control problem aims at finding a therapy, encoded as a source term in the system, both in the form of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, which could lead to the evolution of the phase variable towards a desired final target. First, we prove strong well-posedness for the system of non-linear partial differential equations. In particular, due to the presence of a viscous regularisation, we can also consider double-well potentials of singular type and cross-diffusion terms related to the effects of chemotaxis. Moreover, the particular structure of the reaction terms allows us to prove new regularity results for this kind of system. Then, turning to the optimal control problem, we prove the existence of an optimal therapy and, by studying Fréchet-differentiability properties of the control-to-state operator and the corresponding adjoint system, we obtain the first-order necessary optimality conditions.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:53.568000

This procedure is completely nonparametric as the dissimilarities between stationary distributions are directly calculated without making any model assumptions. In order to justify this procedure, asymptotic properties of the energy distance estimates are derived for general stationary and ergodic time series. The method is illustrated in a simulation study for various component time series that are either linear or nonlinear.

Traditional top-down approaches often struggle to capture critical signals in rapidly changing events. As global events evolve swiftly, social media narratives, including instances of disinformation, become significant sources of insights. To address the need for an inductive strategy, we explore a niche social media platform GAB and an established messaging service Telegram, to develop methodologies applicable on a broader scale. This study investigates narrative evolution on these platforms using quantitative corpus-based discourse analysis techniques. Our approach is a novel mode to study multiple social media domains to distil key information which may be obscured otherwise, allowing for useful and actionable insights. The paper details the technical and methodological aspects of gathering and preprocessing GAB and Telegram data for a keyness (Log Ratio) metric analysis, identifying crucial nouns and verbs for deeper exploration. Empirically, this approach is applied to a case study of a well defined event that had global impact: the 2023 Wagner mutiny. The main findings are: (1) the time line can be deconstructed to provide useful data features allowing for improved interpretation; (2) a methodology is applied which provides a basis for generalization. The key contribution is an approach, that in some cases, provides the ability to capture the dynamic narrative shifts over time with elevated confidence.

In many applications, there exists variation in cyclical patterns from time series in the same group. Although a number of frequency domain methods for the discriminant analysis of time series have been explored, there is a dearth of models and methods that account for within-group spectral variability. This article proposes a model for groups of time series in which transfer functions are modeled as stochastic variables that can account for both between-group and within-group differences in spectra that are identified from individual replicates. An ensuing discriminant analysis of stochastic cepstra under this model is developed to obtain parsimonious measures of relative power that optimally separate groups in the presence of within-group spectral variability. The approach possess favorable properties in classifying new observations and can be consistently estimated through a simple discriminant analysis of a finite number of estimated cepstral coefficients. Benefits in accounting for within-group spectral variability are empirically illustrated in a simulation study and through an analysis of gait variability.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:54.550000

Typical operationalizations of Granger causality make a strong assumption that every time point of the effect time series is influenced by a combination of other time series with a fixed time delay. The assumption of fixed time delay also exists in Transfer Entropy, which is considered to be a non-linear version of Granger causality. However, the assumption of the fixed time delay does not hold in many applications, such as collective behavior, financial markets, and many natural phenomena. To address this issue, we develop Variable-lag Granger causality and Variable-lag Transfer Entropy, generalizations of both Granger causality and Transfer Entropy that relax the assumption of the fixed time delay and allow causes to influence effects with arbitrary time delays. In addition, we propose methods for inferring both variable-lag Granger causality and Transfer Entropy relations. In our approaches, we utilize an optimal warping path of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to infer variable-lag causal relations.

The definition of CPS most pertinent to this paper is: A CPS is a system with a coupling of the cyber aspects of computing and communications with the physical aspects of dynamics and engineering that must abide by the laws of physics. This includes sensor networks, real-time and hybrid systems. To ensure that the computation results conform to the laws of physics a linear differential operator (LDO) is embedded in the processing channel for each sensor. In this manner the dynamics of the system can be incorporated prior to performing symbolic analysis. A non-linear quantization is used for the intervals corresponding to the symbols. The intervals are based on observed modes of the system, which can be determined either during an exploratory phase or online during operation of the system. A complete processing channel is called a single channel lexical analyser; one is made available for each sensor on the machine being observed. The implementation of LDO in the system is particularly important since it enables the establishment of a causal link between the observations of the dynamic system and their cause. Without causality there can be no semantics and without semantics no knowledge acquisition based on the physical background of the system being observed. Correlation alone is not a guarantee for causality. This work was originally motivated from the observation of large bulk mate- rial handling systems. Typically, there are $n = 150\dots250$ sensors per machine, and data is collected in a multi rate manner; whereby general sensors are sampled with $f_s = 1Hz$ and vibration data being sampled in the kilo-hertz range.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:54.558000

In multivariate time series forecasting, each variable depends on its historical values and there are inter-dependencies among variables as well.

To move towards this goal, we propose the Time Series Attention Transformer (TSAT) for multivariate time series representation learning. Using TSAT, we represent both temporal information and inter-dependencies of multivariate time series in terms of edge-enhanced dynamic graphs. The intra-series correlations are represented by nodes in a dynamic graph; a self-attention mechanism is modified to capture the inter-series correlations by using the super-empirical mode decomposition (SMD) module. We applied the embedded dynamic graphs to times series forecasting problems, including two real-world datasets and two benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments show that TSAT clearly outerperforms six state-of-the-art baseline methods in various forecasting horizons.

Therefore those lower-dimensional series can be analysed separately as far as the linear dynamic structure is concerned. Technically it boils down to an eigenanalysis for a positive definite matrix. When $p$ is large, an additional step is required to perform a permutation in terms of either maximum cross-correlations or FDR based on multiple tests. The asymptotic theory is established for both fixed $p$ and diverging $p$ when the sample size $n$ tends to infinity. Numerical experiments with both simulated and real data sets indicate that the proposed method is an effective initial step in analysing multiple time series data, which leads to substantial dimension reduction in modelling and forecasting high-dimensional linear dynamical structures. Unlike PCA for independent data, there is no guarantee that the required linear transformation exists. When it does not, the proposed method provides an approximate segmentation which leads to the advantages in, for example, forecasting for future values. The method can also be adapted to segment multiple volatility processes.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:54.565000

Existing frequency-domain augmentations disturb the original data with various full-spectrum noises, leading to excess domain gap between augmented and original data. Although impressive performance has been achieved in certain cases, frequency-domain DA has yet to be generalized to time series prediction datasets. In this paper, we found that frequency-domain augmentations can be significantly improved by two modifications that limit the perturbations. First, we found that limiting the perturbation to only dominant frequencies significantly outperforms full-spectrum perturbations. Dominant fre quencies represent the main periodicity and trends of the signal and are more important than other frequencies. Second, we found that simply shuffling the dominant frequency components is superior over sophisticated designed random perturbations. Shuffle rearranges the original components (magnitudes and phases) and limits the external noise. With these two modifications, we proposed dominant shuffle, a simple yet effective data augmentation for time series prediction. Our method is very simple yet powerful and can be implemented with just a few lines of code. Extensive experiments with eight datasets and six popular time series models demonstrate that our method consistently improves the baseline performance under various settings and significantly outperforms other DA methods.

However, the potential of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly vision-language models, for time series remains largely under-explored. One natural way for humans to detect time series anomalies is through visualization and textual description. Motivated by this, we raise a critical and practical research question: Can multimodal LLMs perform time series anomaly detection? To answer this, we propose VisualTimeAnomaly benchmark to evaluate MLLMs in time series anomaly detection (TSAD). Our approach transforms time series numerical data into the image format and feed these images into various MLLMs, including proprietary models (GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5) and open-source models (LLaVA-NeXT and Qwen2-VL), each with one larger and one smaller variant. In total, VisualTimeAnomaly contains 12.4k time series images spanning 3 scenarios and 3 anomaly granularities with 9 anomaly types across 8 MLLMs. Starting with the univariate case (point- and range-wise anomalies), we extend our evaluation to more practical scenarios, including multivariate and irregular time series scenarios, and variate-wise anomalies. Our study reveals several key insights:
  1) MLLMs detect range- and variate-wise anomalies more effectively than point-wise anomalies.
  2) MLLMs are highly robust to irregular time series, even with 25% of the data missing.
  3) Open-source MLLMs perform comparably to proprietary models in TSAD. While open-source MLLMs excel on univariate time series, proprietary MLLMs demonstrate superior effectiveness on multivariate time series.

The loading and unloading sequences generated by strain gauges can be identified through time series classification (TSC) algorithms. Recently, deep learning models, e.g., convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable success in the TSC task, as they can extract discriminative local features from the subsequences to identify the time series. However, we observe that only the local features may not be sufficient for expressing the time series, especially when the local sub-sequences between different time series are very similar, e.g., SGS data of aircraft wings in static strength experiments. Nevertheless, CNNs suffer from the limitation in extracting global features due to the nature of convolution operations. For extracting global features to more comprehensively represent the SGS time series, we propose two insights: (i) Constructing global features through feature engineering. (ii) Learning high-order relationships between local features to capture global features. To realize and utilize them, we propose a hypergraph-based global feature learning and fusion framework, which learns and fuses global features for semantic consistency to enhance the representation of SGS time series, thereby improving recognition accuracy.

However, existing metric learning approaches focus on tackling variations mainly using a strict alignment of two sequences, thereby being not able to capture temporal dependencies. To overcome this limitation, we propose MLAT, which covers both alignment and temporal dependencies at the same time. MLAT achieves the alignment effect as well as preserves temporal dependencies by augmenting a given time series using a sliding window. Furthermore, MLAT employs time-invariant metric learning to derive the most appropriate distance measure from the augmented samples which can also capture the temporal dependencies among them well. We show that MLAT outperforms other existing algorithms in the extensive experiments on various real-world data sets.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:54.652000

The suggested methodology can be potentially applied to a broad range of test statistics of the hypotheses of interest. As an example, we establish validity for approximating the distribution under the null of a test statistic based on the Hilbert-Schmidt distance of the corresponding sample lag-zero autocovariance operators, and show consistency under the alternative.

In this paper, we propose a unified framework for understanding contrastive learning through the lens of cosine similarity, and present two key theoretical insights derived from this framework. First, in full-batch settings, we show that perfect alignment of positive pairs is unattainable when negative-pair similarities fall below a threshold, and this misalignment can be mitigated by incorporating within-view negative pairs into the objective. Second, in mini-batch settings, smaller batch sizes induce stronger separation among negative pairs in the embedding space, i.e., higher variance in their similarities, which in turn degrades the quality of learned representations compared to full-batch settings. To address this, we propose an auxiliary loss that reduces the variance of negative-pair similarities in mini-batch settings.

This paper makes progress along this direction by introducing the moment-adjusted stochastic gradient descents, a new stochastic optimization method for statistical inference. We establish non-asymptotic theory that characterizes the statistical distribution for certain iterative methods with optimization guarantees. On the statistical front, the theory allows for model mis-specification, with very mild conditions on the data. For optimization, the theory is flexible for both convex and non-convex cases.

The environment is natively multi-agent, spanning the continuum of competitive, cooperative, and independent games, which are situated within procedurally generated physical 3D worlds. The resulting space is exceptionally diverse in terms of the challenges posed to agents, and as such, even measuring the learning progress of an agent is an open research problem. We propose an iterative notion of improvement between successive generations of agents, rather than seeking to maximise a singular objective, allowing us to quantify progress despite tasks being incomparable in terms of achievable rewards. We show that through constructing an open-ended learning process, which dynamically changes the training task distributions and training objectives such that the agent never stops learning, we achieve consistent learning of new behaviours. The resulting agent is able to score reward in every one of our humanly solvable evaluation levels, with behaviour generalising to many held-out points in the universe of tasks. Examples of this zero-shot generalisation include good performance on Hide and Seek, Capture the Flag, and Tag. Through analysis and hand-authored probe tasks we characterise the behaviour of our agent, and find interesting emergent heuristic behaviours such as trial-and-error experimentation, simple tool use, option switching, and cooperation.

Identifiability refers to determining algorithm-agnostic conditions that ensure the recovery of the true latent causal variables and the underlying latent causal graph. Achievability refers to the algorithmic aspects and addresses designing algorithms that achieve identifiability guarantees. By drawing novel connections between score functions (i.e., the gradients of the logarithm of density functions) and CRL, this paper designs a score-based class of algorithms that ensures both identifiability and achievability. First, the paper focuses on linear transformations and shows that one stochastic hard intervention per node suffices to guarantee identifiability. It also provides partial identifiability guarantees for soft interventions, including identifiability up to mixing with parents for general causal models and perfect recovery of the latent graph for sufficiently nonlinear causal models. Secondly, it focuses on general transformations and demonstrates that two stochastic hard interventions per node are sufficient for identifiability.

A promising approach for alleviating these limitations is to cast the development of better RL algorithms as a machine learning problem itself in a process called meta-RL. Meta-RL is most commonly studied in a problem setting where, given a distribution of tasks, the goal is to learn a policy that is capable of adapting to any new task from the task distribution with as little data as possible. In this survey, we describe the meta-RL problem setting in detail as well as its major variations. We discuss how, at a high level, meta-RL research can be clustered based on the presence of a task distribution and the learning budget available for each individual task. Using these clusters, we then survey meta-RL algorithms and applications. We conclude by presenting the open problems on the path to making meta-RL part of the standard toolbox for a deep RL practitioner.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:57.180000

It exploits the geometry of the loss function while only requiring stochastic approximations of the function values and the generalized gradients. This makes INNA fully implementable and adapted to large-scale optimization problems such as the training of deep neural networks. The algorithm combines both gradient-descent and Newton-like behaviors as well as inertia. We prove the convergence of INNA for most deep learning problems. To do so, we provide a well-suited framework to analyze deep learning loss functions involving tame optimization in which we study a continuous dynamical system together with its discrete stochastic approximations. We prove sublinear convergence for the continuous-time differential inclusion which underlies our algorithm. Additionally, we also show how standard optimization mini-batch methods applied to non-smooth non-convex problems can yield a certain type of spurious stationary points never discussed before. We address this issue by providing a theoretical framework around the new idea of $D$-criticality; we then give a simple asymptotic analysis of INNA. Our algorithm allows for using an aggressive learning rate of $o(1/\log k)$. From an empirical viewpoint, we show that INNA returns competitive results with respect to state of the art (stochastic gradient descent, ADAGRAD, ADAM) on popular deep learning benchmark problems.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:57.188000

However, IoT sensors and deep learning (DL) algorithms, both are known for their vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks. In the context of PdM systems, such attacks can have catastrophic consequences as they are hard to detect due to the nature of the attack. To date, the majority of the published literature focuses on the accuracy of DL enabled PdM systems and often ignores the effect of such attacks. In this paper, we demonstrate the effect of IoT sensor attacks on a PdM system.

The obtained results show that the GRU-based PdM model outperforms some of the recent literature on RUL prediction using the C-MAPSS dataset. Afterward, we model two different types of false data injection attacks (FDIA) on turbofan engine sensor data and evaluate their impact on CNN, LSTM, and GRU-based PdM systems. The obtained results demonstrate that FDI attacks on even a few IoT sensors can strongly defect the RUL prediction. However, the GRU-based PdM model performs better in terms of accuracy and resiliency.

Managing data flow is becoming an important part of the IoMT because it will dictate in which platform analytical tasks should run in the future. Data flows are usually a sequence of out-of-order tuples with a high data input rate, and mobility analytics requires a real-time flow of data in both directions, from the edge to the cloud, and vice-versa. Before pulling the data streams to the cloud, edge data stream processing is needed for detecting missing, broken, and duplicated tuples in addition to recognize tuples whose arrival time is out of order. Analytical tasks such as data filtering, data cleaning and low-level data contextualization can be executed at the edge of a network. In contrast, more complex analytical tasks such as graph processing can be deployed in the cloud, and the results of ad-hoc queries and streaming graph analytics can be pushed to the edge as needed by a user application.

Semi-structured interviews with six middle school students revealed three key insights: (1) participants highly valued learner control for an enhanced learning experience and better self-regulation, especially because most wanted to avoid losses in skill mastery; (2) only seeing their skill mastery estimates often made participants base problem selection on their weaknesses; and (3) what-if explanations stimulated participants to focus more on their strengths and improve skills until they were mastered.

Data-driven solutions are increasingly used in critical socio-technical applications where ensuring fairness is important. Rather than explicitly encoding decision logic via control and data structures, the ML developers provide input data, perform some pre-processing, choose ML algorithms, and tune hyperparameters (HPs) to infer a program that encodes the decision logic. Prior works report that the selection of HPs can significantly influence fairness. However, tuning HPs to find an ideal trade-off between accuracy, precision, and fairness has remained an expensive and tedious task. Can we predict fairness of HP configuration for a given dataset? Are the predictions robust to distribution shifts?
  We focus on group fairness notions and investigate the HP space of 5 training algorithms. We first find that tree regressors and XGBoots significantly outperformed deep neural networks and support vector machines in accurately predicting the fairness of HPs. When predicting the fairness of ML hyperparameters under temporal distribution shift, the tree regressors outperforms the other algorithms with reasonable accuracy. However, the precision depends on the ML training algorithm, dataset, and protected attributes. For example, the tree regressor model was robust for training data shift from 2014 to 2018 on logistic regression and discriminant analysis HPs with sex as the protected attribute; but not for race and other training algorithms.

We develop an asymptotic theory for two types of SPCs: single SPCs and the divided SPCs. Our results demonstrate that they offer complementary strengths. Single SPCs work well with smaller datasets and provide excellent power when there is substantial misspecification, such as when the estimate uncertainty in the test statistic is significantly underestimated. When the sample size is large, divided SPCs can provide better power and are able to detect more subtle form of misspecification. We validate the finite-sample utility of SPCs through extensive simulation experiments in exponential family and hierarchical models, and provide three real-data examples where SPCs offer novel insights and additional flexibility beyond what is available when using posterior predictive checks.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:59.113000

Often, it is difficult to explore the relationships between the learned parameters and the model performance due to a large number of parameters and different random initializations. In this paper, we present a visual analytics approach to compare two different snapshots of a trained CNN model taken after different numbers of epochs, so as to provide some insight into the design or the training of a better CNN model. Our system compares snapshots by exploring the differences in operation parameters and the corresponding blob data at different levels. A case study has been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:49:59.140000

Implemented in a GPU-accelerated BoTorch stack with Matern-5/2 Gaussian process surrogates, our numerical results show improved optimisation quality across benchmark tasks and that structured latent manifolds improve BO performance. Additionally, we compare random embeddings and VAEs as two mechanisms for dimensionality reduction, showing that the latter outperforms the former.

Guerreiro, Matteo di Volo, Boris Gutkin",2022,"Collective dynamics of spiking networks of neurons has been of central interest to both computation neuroscience and network science. Over the past years a new generation of neural population models based on exact reductions (ER) of spiking networks have been developed. However, most of these efforts have been limited to networks of neurons with simple dynamics (e.g. the quadratic integrate and fire models). Here, we present an extension of ER to conductance-based networks of two-dimensional Izhikevich neuron models. We employ an adiabatic approximation, which allows us to analytically solve the continuity equation describing the evolution of the state of the neural population and thus to reduce model dimensionality. We validate our results by showing that the reduced mean-field description we derived can qualitatively and quantitatively describe the macroscopic behaviour of populations of two-dimensional QIF neurons with different electrophysiological profiles (regular firing, adapting, resonator and type III excitable). Most notably, we apply this technique to develop an ER for networks of neurons with bursting dynamics.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:50:01.015000

Through phase reduction theory, we can systematically simplify the nonlinear multi-dimensional differential equations describing a limit-cycle oscillator to a one-dimensional phase equation, which is much easier to analyze. Classical applications of this theory, i.e., the phase locking of an oscillator to a periodic external forcing and the mutual synchronization of interacting oscillators, are explained. Further, more recent applications of this theory to the synchronization of non-interacting oscillators induced by common noise and the dynamics of coupled oscillators on complex networks are discussed.

This is especially true in single vision and language domains, where it helps balance computational costs, memory usage, and inference latency. Despite these advances, this paper argues that token reduction should transcend its traditional efficiency-oriented role in the era of large generative models. Instead, we position it as a fundamental principle in generative modeling, critically influencing both model architecture and broader applications. Specifically, we contend that across vision, language, and multimodal systems, token reduction can: (i) facilitate deeper multimodal integration and alignment, (ii) mitigate ""overthinking"" and hallucinations, (iii) maintain coherence over long inputs, and (iv) enhance training stability, etc. We reframe token reduction as more than an efficiency measure.

Therefore, the reduced dataset cannot be used to further analyze its relationship with some other kind of responses, i.e., it loses its generalizability.

Following Lewis, we take it as a species of reduction. We start by expounding reduction in a broadly Nagelian sense. Then we argue that Lewis's functionalism is an improvement on Nagelian reduction. This paper thereby sets the scene for the other papers, which will apply our framework to theories of space and time.
  Overall, we come to praise spacetime functionalism, not to bury it. But we criticize the recent philosophical literature for failing to stress:
  (i) functionalism's being a species of reduction (in particular: reduction of chrono-geometry to the physics of matter and radiation);
  (ii) functionalism's idea of specifying several concepts simultaneously by their roles;
  (iii) functionalism's providing bridge laws that are mandatory, not optional: they are statements of identity (or co-extension) that are conclusions of a deductive argument; and once we infer them, we have a reduction in a Nagelian sense.
  On the other hand, some of the older philosophical literature, and the mathematical physics literature, is faithful to these ideas (i) to (iii). In various papers, falling under various research programmes, the unique definability of a chrono-geometric concept (or concepts) in terms of matter and radiation, and a corresponding bridge law and reduction, is secured by a precise theorem.

This construction meets both the diversity and accuracy criteria which are required to construct an ensemble classifier where the former criterion is obtained by the various input parameter values and the latter is achieved due to the decorrelation and noise reduction properties of dimensionality reduction. In order to classify a test sample, it is first embedded into the dimension reduced space of each individual classifier by using an out-of-sample extension algorithm.

In many of such applications, control can only be implemented at the population level, i.e., through broadcasting an input signal to all the systems in the population, and this new control paradigm challenges the classical systems theory. In recent years, considerable efforts have been made to investigate controllability properties of ensemble systems, and most works emphasized on linear and some forms of bilinear and nonlinear ensemble systems. In this paper, we study controllability of a broad class of bilinear ensemble systems defined on semisimple Lie groups, for which we define the notion of ensemble controllability through a Riemannian structure of the state space Lie group. Leveraging the Cartan decomposition of semisimple Lie algebras in representation theory, we develop a \emph{covering method} that decomposes the state space Lie group into a collection of Lie subgroups generating the Lie group, which enables the determination of ensemble controllability by controllability of the subsystems evolving on these Lie subgroups. Using the covering method, we show the equivalence between ensemble and classical controllability, i.e., controllability of each individual system in the ensemble implies ensemble controllability, for bilinear ensemble systems evolving on semisimple Lie groups.

In this paper, we propose a moment-based ensemble control framework, which incorporates and expands the method of moments in probability theory to control theory.

While initial research in the area focused on deterministic forecasting, recent works have used diffusion models to produce skillful ensemble forecasts. These models are trained on a single forecasting step and rolled out autoregressively. However, they are computationally expensive and accumulate errors for high temporal resolution due to the many rollout steps. We address these limitations with Continuous Ensemble Forecasting, a novel and flexible method for sampling ensemble forecasts in diffusion models. The method can generate temporally consistent ensemble trajectories completely in parallel, with no autoregressive steps. Continuous Ensemble Forecasting can also be combined with autoregressive rollouts to yield forecasts at an arbitrary fine temporal resolution without sacrificing accuracy. We demonstrate that the method achieves competitive results for global weather forecasting with good probabilistic properties.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:50:08.244000

However, the conventional discriminative deep learning classifiers produce uncalibrated closed-set predictions for OOD data. A more robust classifiers with the uncertainty estimation typically require a potentially unavailable OOD dataset for outlier exposure training, or a considerable amount of additional memory and compute to build ensemble models. In this work, we improve on uncertainty estimation without extra OOD data or additional inference costs using an alternative Split-Ensemble method. Specifically, we propose a novel subtask-splitting ensemble training objective, where a common multiclass classification task is split into several complementary subtasks. Then, each subtask's training data can be considered as OOD to the other subtasks. Diverse submodels can therefore be trained on each subtask with OOD-aware objectives. The subtask-splitting objective enables us to share low-level features across submodels to avoid parameter and computational overheads. In particular, we build a tree-like Split-Ensemble architecture by performing iterative splitting and pruning from a shared backbone model, where each branch serves as a submodel corresponding to a subtask. This leads to improved accuracy and uncertainty estimation across submodels under a fixed ensemble computation budget. Empirical study with ResNet-18 backbone shows Split-Ensemble, without additional computation cost, improves accuracy over a single model by 0.8%, 1.8%, and 25.5% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet, respectively.

To address these issues, we propose a multi-feature method for generating watermarks that combines multiple distinct watermark features into an ensemble watermark. Concretely, we combine acrostica and sensorimotor norms with the established red-green watermark to achieve a 98% detection rate. After a paraphrasing attack, the performance remains high with 95% detection rate. In comparison, the red-green feature alone as a baseline achieves a detection rate of 49% after paraphrasing. The evaluation of all feature combinations reveals that the ensemble of all three consistently has the highest detection rate across several LLMs and watermark strength settings. Due to the flexibility of combining features in the ensemble, various requirements and trade-offs can be addressed. Additionally, the same detection function can be used without adaptations for all ensemble configurations.

Knape and Korner-Nievergelt (2015) showed that under certain models of probability of detection single-visit methods are statistically non-identifiable leading to biased population estimates. There is a close relationship between estimation of the resource selection probability function (RSPF) using weighted distributions and single-visit methods for occupancy and abundance estimation. We explain the precise mathematical conditions needed for RSPF estimation as stated in Lele and Keim (2006). The identical conditions, that remained unstated in our papers on single-visit methodology, are needed for single-visit methodology to work. We show that the class of admissible models is quite broad and does not excessively restrict the application of the RSPF or the single-visit methodology. To complement the work by Knape and Korner-Nievergelt, we study the performance of multiple-visit methods under the scaled logistic detection function and a much wider set of situations. In general, under the scaled logistic detection function multiple-visits methods also lead to biased estimates. As a solution to this problem, we extend the single-visit methodology to a class of models that allows use of scaled probability function. We propose a Multinomial extension of single visit methodology that can be used to check whether the detection function satisfies the RSPF condition or not.

Here we show that a traditional semi-parametric model (Cox regression), a random survival forest (RSF) technique and a method based on conditional inference survival ensembles all yield very promising results. However, the last approach has the advantage of being able to correct the inherent bias in RSF models by dividing the procedure into two steps: first selecting the best predictor to perform the splitting and then the best split point for that covariate. The proposed conditional inference survival ensembles method could be readily used in operational environments for early identification of premium players and the parts of the game that may prompt them to become paying users.

Today, it is possible to train models that have thousands of layers and hundreds of billions of parameters. Large-scale deep models have achieved great success, but the enormous computational complexity and gigantic storage requirements make it extremely difficult to implement them in real-time applications. On the other hand, the size of the dataset is still a real problem in many domains. Data are often missing, too expensive, or impossible to obtain for other reasons. Ensemble learning is partially a solution to the problem of small datasets and overfitting. However, ensemble learning in its basic version is associated with a linear increase in computational complexity. We analyzed the impact of the ensemble decision-fusion mechanism and checked various methods of sharing the decisions including voting algorithms. We used the modified knowledge distillation framework as a decision-fusion mechanism which allows in addition compressing of the entire ensemble model into a weight space of a single model. We showed that knowledge distillation can aggregate knowledge from multiple teachers in only one student model and, with the same computational complexity, obtain a better-performing model compared to a model trained in the standard manner. We have developed our own method for mimicking the responses of all teachers at the same time, simultaneously. We tested these solutions on several benchmark datasets.

With ensemble refinement, the properties of dynamic and partially disordered (bio)molecular structures can be characterized by integrating a wide range of experimental data, including measurements of ensemble-averaged observables. We start from a Bayesian formulation in which the posterior is a functional that ranks different configuration space distributions. By maximizing this posterior, we derive an optimal Bayesian ensemble distribution. For discrete configurations, this optimal distribution is identical to that obtained by the maximum entropy ""ensemble refinement of SAXS"" (EROS) formulation. Bayesian replica ensemble refinement enhances the sampling of relevant configurations by imposing restraints on averages of observables in coupled replica molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the strength of the restraint should scale linearly with the number of replicas to ensure convergence to the optimal Bayesian result in the limit of infinitely many replicas. In the ""Bayesian inference of ensembles"" (BioEn) method, we combine the replica and EROS approaches to accelerate the convergence. An adaptive algorithm can be used to sample directly from the optimal ensemble, without replicas.

We thus propose a new attack approach, named mixture of attacks, by rendering attackers capable of multiple generative methods and multiple manipulation sets, to perturb a malware example without ruining its malicious functionality. This naturally leads to a new instantiation of adversarial training, which is further geared to enhancing the ensemble of deep neural networks. We evaluate defenses using Android malware detectors against 26 different attacks upon two practical datasets.

Using repeated stratified cross validation with statistical significance testing, we compare linear models, a single decision tree, and nine ensemble methods. The results show that ensembles can reach high accuracy without large gaps by reducing variance through averaging or controlled boosting. On nearly linear and clean data, linear models already generalize well and ensembles offer little additional benefit. On datasets with meaningful nonlinear structure, tree based ensembles increase test accuracy by 5 to 7 points while keeping gaps below 3 percent. On noisy or highly imbalanced datasets, ensembles remain competitive but require regularization to avoid fitting noise or majority class patterns. We also compute simple dataset complexity indicators, such as linearity score, Fisher ratio, and noise estimate, which explain when ensembles are likely to control variance effectively.

Multi-subject EEG datasets present several kinds of domain shifts due to various inter-individual differences (e.g. brain anatomy, personality and cognitive profile). These domain shifts render multi-subject training a challenging task and also impede robust cross-subject generalization. Inspired by the importance of domain generalization techniques for tackling such issues, we propose a two-stage model ensemble architecture built with multiple feature extractors (first stage) and a shared classifier (second stage), which we train end-to-end with two novel loss terms. The first loss applies curriculum learning, forcing each feature extractor to specialize to a subset of the training subjects and promoting feature diversity. The second loss is an intra-ensemble distillation objective that allows collaborative exchange of knowledge between the models of the ensemble. We compare our method against several state-of-the-art techniques, conducting subject-independent experiments on two large MI datasets, namely PhysioNet and OpenBMI. Our algorithm outperforms all of the methods in both 5-fold cross-validation and leave-one-subject-out evaluation settings, using a substantially lower number of trainable parameters. We demonstrate that our model ensembling approach combining the powers of curriculum learning and collaborative training, leads to high learning capacity and robust performance. Our work addresses the issue of domain shifts in multi-subject EEG datasets, paving the way for calibration-free brain-computer interfaces.

The arguments make crucial use of Brownian resampling invariance properties and correlation inequalities admitted by such Gibbs measures. We obtain sharp one-point upper tail estimates showing that the probability of the value at zero being larger than $θ$ is $\exp(-\frac{4}{3}θ^{3/2}(1+o(1)))$. A key intermediate step is developing a precise understanding of the profile when conditioned on the value at zero equaling $θ$. Our method further allows one to obtain multi-point asymptotics which were out of reach of previous approaches. As an example, we prove sharp explicit two-point upper tail estimates. This framework is then used to establish the corresponding results for the KPZ equation, which are all new. Even for the zero-temperature case of the Airy$_2$ process, our arguments yield new proofs for one-point estimates previously known due to its connections to random matrix theory, as well as new two-point asymptotics. To showcase the reach of the method, we obtain the same results in a purely non-integrable setting under only assumptions of stationarity and extremality in the class of Gibbs measures.

The algorithmic challenge is to choose pixel positions strategically and dynamically to maximally reduce overall depth estimation error. This setting is realized in daytime or nighttime depth completion for autonomous vehicles with a programmable LiDAR. Our method uses an ensemble of predictors to define a sampling probability over pixels. This probability is proportional to the variance of the predictions of ensemble members, thus highlighting pixels that are difficult to predict. By additionally proceeding in several prediction phases, we effectively reduce redundant sampling of similar pixels. Our ensemble-based method may be implemented using any depth-completion learning algorithm, such as a state-of-the-art neural network, treated as a black box. In particular, we also present a simple and effective Random Forest-based algorithm, and similarly use its internal ensemble in our design. We conduct experiments on the KITTI dataset, using the neural network algorithm of Ma et al. and our Random Forest based learner for implementing our method.

The MSE convergence rate of a leave-one-out kernel density plug-in divergence functional estimator for general bounded density support sets is derived where knowledge of the support boundary is not required. The theory of optimally weighted ensemble estimation is generalized to derive a divergence estimator that achieves the parametric rate when the densities are sufficiently smooth. The asymptotic distribution of this estimator and some guidelines for tuning parameter selection are provided. Based on the theory, an empirical estimator of Rényi-$α$ divergence is proposed that outperforms the standard kernel density plug-in estimator, especially in high dimension.

Generalized mutual information measures that go beyond classical Shannon mutual information have also received much interest in these applications. We derive the mean squared error convergence rates of kernel density-based plug-in estimators of general mutual information measures between two multidimensional random variables $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ for two cases: 1) $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ are continuous; 2) $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ may have any mixture of discrete and continuous components. Using the derived rates, we propose an ensemble estimator of these information measures called GENIE by taking a weighted sum of the plug-in estimators with varied bandwidths. The resulting ensemble estimators achieve the $1/N$ parametric mean squared error convergence rate when the conditional densities of the continuous variables are sufficiently smooth. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first nonparametric mutual information estimator known to achieve the parametric convergence rate for the mixture case, which frequently arises in applications (e.g. variable selection in classification). The estimator is simple to implement and it uses the solution to an offline convex optimization problem and simple plug-in estimators. A central limit theorem is also derived for the ensemble estimators and minimax rates are derived for the continuous case.

The accuracy and robustness of the resulting segment region boundaries are enhanced by combining information from multiple simultaneously-evaluated clustering operations. The stacking of object segmentation evaluations is performed using image mask combination operations. This statistically-combined ensemble (SCE) of different cluster masks allows us to construct cluster reliability metrics for each pixel and for the associated segments without any prior user input. By comparing the similarity of different cluster occurrences in the ensemble, we can also assess the optimal number of clusters needed to describe the data. Furthermore, by relying on ensemble-averaged spatial segment region boundaries, the SCE method enables reconstruction of more accurate and robust region of interest (ROI) boundaries for the different image data clusters.

Nevertheless, numerous studies and examples have shown that the PGA methods may fail to achieve the tight approximation ratio for continuous DR-submodular maximization problems. To address this challenge, we present a boosting technique in this paper, which can efficiently improve the approximation guarantee of the standard PGA to \emph{optimal} with only small modifications on the objective function. The fundamental idea of our boosting technique is to exploit non-oblivious search to derive a novel auxiliary function $F$, whose stationary points are excellent approximations to the global maximum of the original DR-submodular objective $f$. Specifically, when $f$ is monotone and $γ$-weakly DR-submodular, we propose an auxiliary function $F$ whose stationary points can provide a better $(1-e^{-γ})$-approximation than the $(γ^2/(1+γ^2))$-approximation guaranteed by the stationary points of $f$ itself. Similarly, for the non-monotone case, we devise another auxiliary function $F$ whose stationary points can achieve an optimal $\frac{1-\min_{\boldsymbol{x}\in\mathcal{C}}\|\boldsymbol{x}\|_{\infty}}{4}$-approximation guarantee where $\mathcal{C}$ is a convex constraint set. In contrast, the stationary points of the original non-monotone DR-submodular function can be arbitrarily bad~\citep{chen2023continuous}. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability of our boosting technique on four problems. In all of these four problems, our resulting variants of boosting PGA algorithm beat the previous standard PGA in several aspects such as approximation ratio and efficiency.

For this reason, we propose the novel 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework SplatPose which, given multi-view images of a 3D object, accurately estimates the pose of unseen views in a differentiable manner, and detects anomalies in them. We achieve state-of-the-art results in both training and inference speed, and detection performance, even when using less training data than competing methods.

However, when small crafted perturbations are introduced to those history trajectories, the resulting anomalous (or adversarial) trajectories can significantly mislead the future trajectory prediction module of the ego vehicle, which may result in unsafe planning and even fatal accidents. Therefore, it is of great importance to detect such anomalous trajectories of the surrounding vehicles for system safety, but few works have addressed this issue. In this work, we propose two novel methods for learning effective and efficient representations for online anomaly detection of vehicle trajectories. Different from general time-series anomaly detection, anomalous vehicle trajectory detection deals with much richer contexts on the road and fewer observable patterns on the anomalous trajectories themselves. To address these challenges, our methods exploit contrastive learning techniques and trajectory semantics to capture the patterns underlying the driving scenarios for effective anomaly detection under supervised and unsupervised settings, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our supervised method based on contrastive learning and unsupervised method based on reconstruction with semantic latent space can significantly improve the performance of anomalous trajectory detection in their corresponding settings over various baseline methods.

In this paper, we aim to understand the effect of a biased anomaly set on anomaly detection. Concretely, we view anomaly detection as a supervised learning task where the objective is to optimize the recall at a given false positive rate. We formally study the relative scoring bias of an anomaly detector, defined as the difference in performance with respect to a baseline anomaly detector. We establish the first finite sample rates for estimating the relative scoring bias for deep anomaly detection, and empirically validate our theoretical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Building on prior work in mobility behavior clustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts and deviations from established routines but also the identification of individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets.

Building on this process, we construct two complementary benchmarks. The image-based benchmark evaluates frame-level reasoning with representative frames, while the video-based benchmark extends to temporally localized segments and incorporates an abnormality scoring task.

Due to their complexity and non-linear nature, it can be challenging to understand their decision-making process. While these models can effectively identify unusual spectra, interpreting the physical nature of the flagged outliers remains a major challenge. We aim to bridge the gap between anomaly detection and physical understanding by combining deep learning with interpretable ML (iML) techniques to identify and explain anomalous galaxy spectra from SDSS data. We present a flexible framework that uses a variational autoencoder to compute multiple anomaly scores, including physically-motivated variants of the mean squared error. We adapt the iML LIME algorithm to spectroscopic data, systematically explore segmentation and perturbation strategies, and compute explanation weights that identify the features most responsible for each detection. To uncover population-level trends, we normalize the LIME weights and apply clustering to the top 1\% most anomalous spectra. Our approach successfully separates instrumental artifacts from physically meaningful outliers and groups anomalous spectra into astrophysically coherent categories. These include dusty, metal-rich starbursts; chemically-enriched H\,II regions with moderate excitation; and extreme emission-line galaxies with low metallicity and hard ionizing spectra. The explanation weights align with established emission-line diagnostics, enabling a physically-grounded taxonomy of spectroscopic anomalies. Our work shows that interpretable anomaly detection provides a scalable, transparent, and physically meaningful approach to exploring large spectroscopic datasets.

Those systems are often characterized by a pair of multivariate datasets. To detect anomaly in such a system and localize element(s) associated with anomaly, one would need to estimate scores that quantify anomalousness of the entire system as well as its elements. However, it is not trivial to estimate such scores by considering changes of relationships between the elements, which strongly correlate with each other. Moreover, it is necessary to estimate the scores for the entire system and its elements from a single framework, in order to identify relationships among the scores for localizing elements associated with anomaly. Here, we developed a new method to quantify anomalousness of an entire system and its elements simultaneously.
  The purpose of this paper is threefold. The first one is to propose a new anomaly detection method: Double Kernelized Scoring (DKS). DKS is a unified framework for entire-system anomaly scoring and element-wise anomaly scoring. Therefore, DKS allows for conducting simultaneously 1) anomaly detection for the entire system and 2) localization for identifying faulty elements responsible for the system anomaly. The second purpose is to propose a new kernel function: Matrix Kernel. The Matrix Kernel is defined between general matrices, which might have different dimensions, allowing for conducting anomaly detection on systems where the number of elements change over time. The third purpose is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method experimentally. We evaluated the proposed method with synthetic and real time series data. The results demonstrate that DKS is able to detect anomaly and localize the elements associated with it successfully.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:50:08.669000

Due to such events' rarity, to train deep learning models on the Anomaly Detection (AD) task, scientists only rely on ""normal"" data, i.e., non-anomalous samples. Thus, letting the neural network infer the distribution beneath the input data. In such a context, we propose a novel framework, named Multi-layer One-Class ClassificAtion (MOCCA),to train and test deep learning models on the AD task. Specifically, we applied it to autoencoders. A key novelty in our work stems from the explicit optimization of intermediate representations for the AD task. Indeed, differently from commonly used approaches that consider a neural network as a single computational block, i.e., using the output of the last layer only, MOCCA explicitly leverages the multi-layer structure of deep architectures. Each layer's feature space is optimized for AD during training, while in the test phase, the deep representations extracted from the trained layers are combined to detect anomalies. With MOCCA, we split the training process into two steps. First, the autoencoder is trained on the reconstruction task only. Then, we only retain the encoder tasked with minimizing the L_2 distance between the output representation and a reference point, the anomaly-free training data centroid, at each considered layer. Subsequently, we combine the deep features extracted at the various trained layers of the encoder model to detect anomalies at inference time. To assess the performance of the models trained with MOCCA, we conduct extensive experiments on publicly available datasets. We show that our proposed method reaches comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art approaches available in the literature.",arXiv,2026-01-14 14:50:08.677000

In contrast, more advanced approaches inspired by the recent success of deep learning often lack seamless interpretability of the detected results. To overcome this challenge, we propose the application of adversarial autoencoder networks. We demonstrate that such artificial neural networks are capable of learning a semantic meaningful representation of real-world journal entries. The learned representation provides a holistic view on a given set of journal entries and significantly improves the interpretability of detected accounting anomalies. We show that such a representation combined with the networks reconstruction error can be utilized as an unsupervised and highly adaptive anomaly assessment.

For example, the anomalies in the packet payload can be expressed as a number of specific strings which may cause attacks. Although some approaches have achieved remarkable progress, they are with limited applications since they are dependent on in-depth expert knowledge, e.g., signatures describing anomalies or communication protocol at the application level. Moreover, they might fail to detect the payload anomalies that have long-term dependency relationships. To overcome these limitations and adaptively detect anomalies from the packet payload, we propose a deep learning based framework which consists of two steps. First, a novel feature engineering method is proposed to obtain the block-based features via block sequence extraction and block embedding. The block-based features could encapsulate both the high-dimension information and the underlying sequential information which facilitate the anomaly detection. Second, a neural network is designed to learn the representation of packet payload based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Furthermore, we cast the anomaly detection as a classification problem and stack a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) on the above representation learning network to detect anomalies.

To overcome this challenge, we present the tiled ensemble approach, which reduces memory consumption by dividing the input images into a grid of tiles and training a dedicated model for each tile location. The tiled ensemble is compatible with any existing anomaly detection model without the need for any modification of the underlying architecture. By introducing overlapping tiles, we utilize the benefits of traditional stacking ensembles, leading to further improvements in anomaly detection capabilities beyond high resolution alone. We perform a comprehensive analysis using diverse underlying architectures, including Padim, PatchCore, FastFlow, and Reverse Distillation, on two standard anomaly detection datasets: MVTec and VisA.

We then present a novel general framework to generate adversarial spoofing signals that violate physical properties of the system, and use the framework to analyze four anomaly detectors published at top security conferences. We find that three of those detectors are susceptible to a number of adversarial manipulations (e.g., spoofing with precomputed patterns), which we call Synthetic Sensor Spoofing and one is resilient against our attacks. We investigate the root of its resilience and demonstrate that it comes from the properties that we introduced. Our attacks reduce the Recall (True Positive Rate) of the attacked schemes making them not able to correctly detect anomalies. Thus, the vulnerabilities we discovered in the anomaly detectors show that (despite an original good detection performance), those detectors are not able to reliably learn physical properties of the system. Even attacks that prior work was expected to be resilient against (based on verified properties) were found to be successful. We argue that our findings demonstrate the need for both more complete attacks in datasets, and more critical analysis of process-based anomaly detectors.

6967ac36e9ba439f2a89377d,arXiv,Cloud Computing,A study of the link between cosmic rays and clouds with a cloud chamber at the CERN PS,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0104048v1,The Cloud Collaboration,2001,"Recent satellite data have revealed a surprising correlation between galactic cosmic ray (GCR) intensity and the fraction of the Earth covered by clouds. If this correlation were to be established by a causal mechanism, it could provide a crucial step in understanding the long-sought mechanism connecting solar and climate variability. The Earth's climate seems to be remarkably sensitive to solar activity, but variations of the Sun's electromagnetic radiation appear to be too small to account for the observed climate variability. However, since the GCR intensity is strongly modulated by the solar wind, a GCR-cloud link may provide a sufficient amplifying mechanism. Moreover if this connection were to be confirmed, it could have profound consequences for our understanding of the solar contributions to the current global warming. The CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets) project proposes to test experimentally the existence a link between cosmic rays and cloud formation, and to understand the microphysical mechanism. CLOUD plans to perform detailed laboratory measurements in a particle beam at CERN, where all the parameters can be precisely controlled and measured.

Multi-cloud serverless is a promising emerging approach against vendor lock-in, yet multiple challenges must be overcome to tap its potential. First, we need to be aware of both the performance and cost of each FaaS provider. Second, a multi-cloud architecture must be proposed before deploying a multi-cloud workflow. Domain-specific serverless offerings must then be integrated into the multi-cloud architecture to improve performance or save costs. Moreover, dealing with serverless offerings from multiple providers is challenging. Finally, we require workload portability support for serverless multi-cloud.

These are two conventional task scheduling algorithm. The selective algorithm uses certain heuristics to select between the two algorithms so that overall makespan of tasks on the machines is minimized.

We obtained upper limits to the U-band emission of 10 brown dwarfs (U>19.6-20.6 mag), whereas 2MASSJ04141188+2811535 was detected in the U-band. Remarkably, the magnitude of this brown dwarf increased regularly from U~19.5 mag at the beginning of the observation, peaked 6h later at U~18.4 mag, and then decreased to U~18.65 mag in the next 2h. The first OM U-band measurement is consistent with the quiescent level observed about one year later thanks to ground follow-up observations. This brown dwarf was not detected in X-rays by XMM-Newton during the OM observation. We discuss the possible sources of U-band variability for this young brown dwarf, namely a magnetic flare, non-steady accretion onto the substellar surface, and rotational modulation of a hot spot.

More importantly, the participating users are still able to settle cost-sharing among themselves in a fair manner for the incurred costs, without knowing each other's private schedules or demands.

Today's cloud brokers attempt to insulate consumers from the vagaries of multiple clouds. To achieve the insulation, the modern cloud broker needs to disguise itself as the end-provider to consumers by creating and operating a virtual data center construct that we call a meta-cloud, which is assembled on top of a set of participating supplier clouds. It is crucial for such a cloud broker to be considered a trusted partner both by cloud consumers and by the underpinning cloud suppliers. A fundamental tenet of brokerage trust is vendor neutrality. On the one hand, cloud consumers will be comfortable if a cloud broker guarantees that they will not be led through a preferred path. And on the other hand, cloud suppliers would be more interested in partnering with a cloud broker who promises a fair apportioning of client provisioning requests. Because consumer and supplier trust on a meta-cloud broker stems from the assumption of being agnostic to supplier clouds, there is a need for a test strategy that verifies the fairness of cloud brokerage. In this paper, we propose a calculus of fairness that defines the rules to determine the operational behavior of a cloud broker. The calculus uses temporal logic to model the fact that fairness is a trait that has to be ascertained over time; it is not a characteristic that can be judged at a per-request fulfillment level. Using our temporal calculus of fairness as the basis, we propose an algorithm to determine the fairness of a broker probabilistically, based on its observed request apportioning policies. Our model for the fairness of cloud broker behavior also factors in inter-provider variables such as cost divergence and capacity variance.",cs.DC,2026-01-14 15:46:14.294000

However, this approach has limitations due to poor robustness under channel fluctuations, reconciliation overhead, and no clear safeguard distance to ensure the secrecy of the generated authentication keys. In this regard, we propose a novel, secure, and lightweight continuous authentication scheme for IoT device authentication. Our scheme utilizes the inherent properties of the IoT devices' transmission model as its source for seed generation and device authentication. Specifically, our proposed scheme provides continuous authentication by checking the access time slots and spreading sequences of the IoT devices instead of repeatedly generating and verifying shared keys. Due to this, access to a coherent key is not required in our proposed scheme, resulting in the concealment of the seed information from attackers. Our proposed authentication scheme for IoT devices demonstrates improved performance compared to the benchmark schemes relying on physical channels. Our empirical results find a near threefold decrease in the misdetection rate of illegitimate devices and close to zero false alarm rate in various system settings with varied numbers of active devices up to 200 and signal-to-noise ratio from 0 dB to 25 dB. Our proposed authentication scheme also has a lower computational complexity of at least half the computational cost of the benchmark schemes based on support vector machine and binary hypothesis testing in our studies. This further corroborates the practicality of our scheme for IoT deployments.","cs.CR, cs.NI, eess.SP",2026-01-14 15:46:29.249000

This article analyzes the performance of this FTM implementation by carrying out and studying several measurement campaigns in different indoor and outdoor scenarios. Additionally, this work proposes an alternative real-time implementation for distance estimation inside the ESP32 using an approach based on machine learning.

We focus here on spatially-distributed Internet-of-Things systems such as smart environments, where the dynamics of spatial distribution of entities in the system is crucial to requirements satisfaction. Analysis techniques need to be in place while systems operate to ensure that requirements are fulfilled. This may be achieved by keeping a model of the system at runtime, monitoring events that lead to changes in the spatial environment, and performing analysis. This computationally-intensive runtime assurance method cannot be supported by resource-constrained devices that populate the space and must be offloaded to the cloud. However, challenges arise regarding resource allocation and cost, especially when the workload is unknown at the system's design time. As such, it may be difficult or even impossible to guarantee application service level agreements, e.g., on response times. To this end, we instantiate spatial verification processes, integrating them to the service layer of an IoT-cloud architecture based on microservices. We propose several cloud deployments for such an architecture for assurance of spatial requirements -- based on virtual machines, containers, and the recent Functions-as-a-Service paradigm. Then, we assess deployments' tradeoffs in terms of elasticity, performance and cost by using a workload scenario from a known dataset of taxis roaming in Beijing.

During this process, everyday objects capture a vast amount of data that can be used to understand individuals and their behaviours. In the current IoT ecosystems, such data is collected and used only by the respective IoT solutions. There is no formal way to share data with external entities. We believe this is very efficient and unfair for users. We believe that users, as data owners, should be able to control, manage, and share data about them in any way that they choose and make or gain value out of them. To achieve this, we proposed the Sensing as a Service (S2aaS) model. In this paper, we discuss the Sensing as a Service ecosystem in terms of its architecture, components and related user interaction designs. This paper aims to highlight the weaknesses of the current IoT ecosystem and to explain how S2aaS would eliminate those weaknesses.

Al-Naffouri",2019,"Magnetic Induction (MI) is an efficient wireless communication method to deploy operational internet of underground things (IOUT) for oil and gas reservoirs. The IOUT consists of underground things which are capable of sensing the underground environment and communicating with the surface. The MI-based IOUT enable many applications, such as monitoring of the oil rigs, optimized fracturing, and optimized extraction. Most of these applications are dependent on the location of the underground things and therefore require accurate localization techniques. The existing localization techniques for MI-based underground sensing networks are two-dimensional and do not characterize the achievable accuracy of the developed methods which are both crucial and challenging tasks. Therefore, this paper presents the expression of the Cramer Rao lower bound (CRLB) for three-dimensional MI-based IOUT localization which takes into account the channel parameters of the underground magnetic-induction. The derived CRLB provide the suggestions for an MI-based underground localization system by associating the system parameters with the error trend. Numerical results demonstrate that localization accuracy is affected by different channel and networks parameters such as the number of anchors, noise variance, frequency, and the number of underground things.",eess.SP,2026-01-14 15:46:29.370000

Considering computational costs and resultant on-chain gas costs, we suggest a bifurcated architecture for VRF design, optimizing interactions between on-chain and off-chain. Our approach employs a secure ring signature supported by NIZK proof and a delegated key generation method, inspired by the Chaum-Pedersen equality proof and the Fiat-Shamir Heuristic. Our VRF scheme integrates multi-party computation (MPC) with blockchain-based decentralized identifiers (DID), ensuring both security and randomness. We elucidate the security and privacy aspects of our VRF scheme, analyzing temporal and spatial complexities.

Accelerating block propagation reduces the mining interval and chance of fork occurring, which in turn increases throughput. Our approach can be applied to the blockchain networks either directly or with a minor modification to the consensus. Through an extensive and large scale simulations, we validate that the proposed PiChu scheme significantly enhances the scalability of blockchain networks. For instance, a 64 MB block can be broadcasted in just 80 seconds in a blockchain network with a million nodes.

Distributed consensus is a fundamental component of blockchain, which is required to ensure trust, security, and integrity of the data stored and the transactions processed in the blockchain. Various consensus algorithms have been developed, each affected from certain issues such as node failures, high resource consumption, collusion, etc. This work introduces a fully decentralised consensus protocol, Blockchain Epidemic Consensus Protocol (BECP), suitable for very large and extreme-scale blockchain systems. The proposed approach leverages the benefits of epidemic protocols, such as no reliance on a fixed set of validators or leaders, probabilistic guarantees of convergence, efficient use of network resources, and tolerance to node and network failures. A comparative experimental analysis has been carried out with traditional protocols including PAXOS, RAFT, and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), as well as a relatively more recent protocol such as Avalanche, which is specifically designed for very large-scale systems. The results illustrate how BECP outperforms them in terms of throughput, scalability and consensus latency. BECP achieves an average of 1.196 times higher throughput in terms of consensus on items and 4.775 times better average consensus latency.

Selecting the wrong implementation could expose an organization to security vulnerabilities, reduce access to its target audience, or cause issues in the future when switching to a more mature protocol. Blockchain interoperability aims to solve this adaptability problem by increasing the extensibility of blockchain, enabling the addition of new use cases and features without sacrificing the performance of the original blockchain. However, most existing blockchain platforms need to be designed for interoperability, and simple operations like sending assets across platforms create problems.

However, the increased complexity and automation of these networks have also escalated cybersecurity risks. Existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) leveraging traditional Machine Learning (ML) techniques have shown effectiveness in mitigating these risks, but they often require extensive manual effort and expert knowledge. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)-based autonomous IDS framework towards achieving autonomous cybersecurity for next-generation networks. To achieve autonomous intrusion detection, the proposed AutoML framework automates all critical procedures of the data analytics pipeline, including data pre-processing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model ensemble. Specifically, it utilizes a Tabular Variational Auto-Encoder (TVAE) method for automated data balancing, tree-based ML models for automated feature selection and base model learning, Bayesian Optimization (BO) for hyperparameter optimization, and a novel Optimized Confidence-based Stacking Ensemble (OCSE) method for automated model ensemble. The proposed AutoML-based IDS was evaluated on two public benchmark network security datasets, CICIDS2017 and 5G-NIDD, and demonstrated improved performance compared to state-of-the-art cybersecurity methods. This research marks a significant step towards fully autonomous cybersecurity in next-generation networks, potentially revolutionizing network security applications.","cs.LG, cs.CR, cs.NI",2026-01-14 15:46:53.708000

Nurse,2025,"As technology has become more embedded into our society, the security of modern-day systems is paramount. One topic which is constantly under discussion is that of patching, or more specifically, the installation of updates that remediate security vulnerabilities in software or hardware systems. This continued deliberation is motivated by complexities involved with patching; in particular, the various incentives and disincentives for organizations and their cybersecurity teams when deciding whether to patch. In this paper, we take a fresh look at the question of patching and critically explore why organizations and IT/security teams choose to patch or decide against it (either explicitly or due to inaction). We tackle this question by aggregating and synthesizing prominent research and industry literature on the incentives and disincentives for patching, specifically considering the human aspects in the context of these motives. Through this research, this study identifies key motivators such as organizational needs, the IT/security team's relationship with vendors, and legal and regulatory requirements placed on the business and its staff. There are also numerous significant reasons discovered for why the decision is taken not to patch, including limited resources (e.g., person-power), challenges with manual patch management tasks, human error, bad patches, unreliable patch management tools, and the perception that related vulnerabilities would not be exploited. These disincentives, in combination with the motivators above, highlight the difficult balance that organizations and their security teams need to maintain on a daily basis. Finally, we conclude by discussing implications of these findings and important future considerations.","cs.CR, cs.AI, cs.CY, cs.HC",2026-01-14 15:46:53.724000

It is well-established that data obtained from space assets is fundamental to NATO, as they allow for the facilitation of its missions, self-defence and effective deterrence of its adversaries. Any hostile cyber operation, suspending control over a space asset, severely impacts both NATO missions and allied Member States national security. This threat is exacerbated by NATOs mostly unregulated cyber SASC. Hence, this thesis answers a twofold research question: a) What are current cybersecurity gaps along NATOs global SASC; and b) How can NATO and its allied Member States gain greater control over such gaps to safeguard the supply of NATO mission-critical information? An ontological field study is carried out by conducting nineteen semi-structured interviews with high-level representatives from relevant public, private and academic organizations. This research was undertaken in collaboration with the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Tallinn, Estonia. This thesis concludes that current cybersecurity gaps along NATOs SASC are caused by cyber vulnerabilities such as legacy systems or the use of Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) technology. Inadequate cyber SASC management is caused by hindrances such as misaligned classification levels and significant understaffing. On this basis, NATO should consider two major collaboration initiatives: a) Raising Awareness throughout the whole of the NATO system, and b) Pushing forward the creation of regulation through a standardized security framework on SASC cybersecurity. Doing so would enable NATO and its Member States to recognise cyberthreats to mission-critical data early on along its cyber SASC, and thus increase transparency, responsibility, and liability.","cs.CR, cs.CY",2026-01-14 15:46:53.730000

Little is known however on the incentives set by bug bounty programs: How they drive new bug discoveries, and how they supposedly improve security through the progressive exhaustion of discoverable vulnerabilities. Here, we recognize that bug bounty programs create tensions, for organizations running them on the one hand, and for security researchers on the other hand. At the level of one bug bounty program, security researchers face a sort of St-Petersburg paradox: The probability of finding additional bugs decays fast, and thus can hardly be matched with a sufficient increase of monetary rewards. Furthermore, bug bounty program managers have an incentive to gather the largest possible crowd to ensure a larger pool of expertise, which in turn increases competition among security researchers. As a result, we find that researchers have high incentives to switch to newly launched programs, for which a reserve of low-hanging fruit vulnerabilities is still available. Our results inform on the technical and economic mechanisms underlying the dynamics of bug bounty program contributions, and may in turn help improve the mechanism design of bug bounty programs that get increasingly adopted by cybersecurity savvy organizations.","cs.CR, physics.soc-ph",2026-01-14 15:46:53.735000

Using a qualitative policy-analysis and conceptual policy-design approach, we reconstruct a seven-dimension preventive architecture: awareness and visibility, human behaviour, access control, system hygiene, data protection, detection and response, and continuous review, and justify each dimension's contribution to proportionality and risk reduction. We then map the model's regulatory scope and limits against the NIS2 Directive, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2690, the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), and the EU Action Plan on Cybersecurity for Hospitals, clarifying which obligations are supported and which require complementary governance (e.g. role accountability, incident timelines, statements of applicability, sector-specific testing and procurement). The analysis argues that raising awareness is the fastest, scalable lever to increase cyber-risk sensitivity in micro-SMEs and complements, rather than replaces, formal compliance.

This is because these tools rely on known patches and signatures, which do not exist for new zero-day attacks. Furthermore, existing machine learning methods, which are trained on specific and occasionally outdated malware samples, may struggle to adapt to features in new malware. To address this issue, there is a need for a more robust machine learning model that can identify relationships between malware samples without being trained on a particular malware feature set. This is particularly crucial in the field of cybersecurity, where the number of malware samples is limited and obfuscation techniques are widely used. Current approaches using stacked autoencoders aim to remove the noise introduced by obfuscation techniques through reconstruction of the input. However, this approach ignores the semantic relationships between features across different malware samples. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Siamese Neural Network (SNN) that uses relation-aware embeddings to calculate more accurate similarity probabilities based on semantic details of different malware samples. In addition, by using entropy images as inputs, our model can extract better structural information and subtle differences in malware signatures, even in the presence of obfuscation techniques.

Remarkably, NIS search and response times do not scale appreciably with the physical size of the animal in which its search is conducted. Many distributed systems are engineered to solve analogous problems, and the NIS demonstrates how such engineered systems can achieve desirable scalability. We hypothesize that the architecture of the NIS, composed of a hierarchical decentralized detection network of lymph nodes (LN) facilitates efficient search and response. A sub-modular architecture in which LN numbers and size both scale with organism size is shown to efficiently balance tradeoffs between local antigen detection and global antibody production, leading to nearly scale-invariant detection and response. We characterize the tradeoffs as balancing local and global communication and show that similar tradeoffs exist in distributed systems like LN inspired artificial immune system (AIS) applications and peer-to-peer (P2P) systems. Taking inspiration from the architecture of the NIS, we propose a modular RADAR (Robust Adaptive Decentralized search with Automated Response) strategy for distributed systems. We demonstrate how two existing distributed systems (a LN inspired multi-robot control application and a P2P system) can be improved by a modular RADAR strategy. Such a sub-modular architecture is shown to balance the tradeoffs between local communication (within artificial LNs and P2P clusters) and global communication (between artificial LNs and P2P clusters), leading to efficient search and response.","cs.DC, q-bio.PE",2026-01-14 15:47:39.267000

We assume that the following process continues for up to n rounds where n is the total number of nodes initially in the network: the adversary deletes an arbitrary node from the network, then the network responds by quickly adding a small number of new edges.   We present a distributed data structure that ensures two key properties. First, the diameter of the network is never more than $O(\log Δ)$ times its original diameter, where $Δ$ is the maximum degree of the network initially. We note that for many peer-to-peer systems, $Δ$ is polylogarithmic, so the diameter increase would be a O(log log n) multiplicative factor. Second, the degree of any node never increases by more than 3 over its original degree. Our data structure is fully distributed, has O(1) latency per round and requires each node to send and receive O(1) messages per round. The data structure requires an initial setup phase that has latency equal to the diameter of the original network, and requires, with high probability, each node v to send O(log n) messages along every edge incident to v. Our approach is orthogonal and complementary to traditional topology-based approaches to defending against attack.","cs.DC, cs.NI",2026-01-14 15:47:39.281000

The framework introduced in this paper explicitly incorporates costs of connection and the benefits that are received by direct and indirect access to resources and provides measures of the optimality of connectivity structures.

We develop a distributed observer that guarantees asymptotic reconstruction of the state for the most general class of LTI systems, sensor network topologies and sensor measurement structures. Our analysis builds upon the following key observation - a given node can reconstruct a portion of the state solely by using its own measurements and constructing appropriate Luenberger observers; hence it only needs to exchange information with neighbors (via consensus dynamics) for estimating the portion of the state that is not locally detectable. This intuitive approach leads to a new class of distributed observers with several appealing features. Furthermore, by imposing additional constraints on the system dynamics and network topology, we show that it is possible to construct a simpler version of the proposed distributed observer that achieves the same objective while admitting a fully distributed design phase. Our general framework allows extensions to time-varying networks that result from communication losses, and scenarios including faults or attacks at the nodes.",eess.SY,2026-01-14 15:47:39.287000

Satisfying such requirements is a complex task both due to the volatile nature of distributed environments, as well as due to numerous domain-specific factors that affect message latency. Prompt detection of the root-cause of excessive message delay allows a distributed system to react accordingly. This may significantly improve compliance with the required timeliness constraints.   In this work, we present a novel approach for distributed performance monitoring of soft-real time distributed systems. We propose to employ recent distributed algorithms from the statistical signal processing and learning domains, and to utilize them in a different context of online performance monitoring and root-cause analysis, for pinpointing the reasons for violation of performance requirements. Our approach is general and can be used for monitoring of any distributed system, and is not limited to the soft real-time domain.   We have implemented the proposed framework in TransFab, an IBM prototype of soft real-time messaging fabric. In addition to root-cause analysis, the framework includes facilities to resolve resource allocation problems, such as memory and bandwidth deficiency.

Erasure codes are widely deployed in practical storage systems to provide fault tolerance with low storage overhead. However, random data distribution (RDD), commonly used in erasure-coded storage systems, induces heavy cross-rack traffic, load imbalance, and random access, which adversely affects failure recovery. In this paper, with orthogonal arrays, we define a Deterministic Data Distribution ($D^3$) to uniformly distribute data/parity blocks among nodes, and propose an efficient failure recovery approach based on $D^3$, which minimizes the cross-rack repair traffic against a single node failure. Thanks to the uniformity of $D^3$, the proposed recovery approach balances the repair traffic not only among nodes within a rack but also among racks. We implement $D^3$ over Reed-Solomon codes and Locally Repairable Codes in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) with a cluster of 28 machines. Compared with RDD, our experiments show that $D^3$ significantly speeds up the failure recovery up to 2.49 times for RS codes and 1.38 times for LRCs.

Leung, Bong Jun Ko",2019,"Large-scale distributed computing systems often contain thousands of distributed nodes (machines). Monitoring the conditions of these nodes is important for system management purposes, which, however, can be extremely resource demanding as this requires collecting local measurements of each individual node and constantly sending those measurements to a central controller. Meanwhile, it is often useful to forecast the future system conditions for various purposes such as resource planning/allocation and anomaly detection, but it is usually too resource-consuming to have one forecasting model running for each node, which may also neglect correlations in observed metrics across different nodes. In this paper, we propose a mechanism for collecting and forecasting the resource utilization of machines in a distributed computing system in a scalable manner. We present an algorithm that allows each local node to decide when to transmit its most recent measurement to the central node, so that the transmission frequency is kept below a given constraint value. Based on the measurements received from local nodes, the central node summarizes the received data into a small number of clusters. Since the cluster partitioning can change over time, we also present a method to capture the evolution of clusters and their centroids. As an effective way to reduce the amount of computation, time-series forecasting models are trained on the time-varying centroids of each cluster, to forecast the future resource utilizations of a group of local nodes.

In this paper, we seek to highlight the role that the underlying interaction network plays in determining the performance of the collective behaviour of a system, comparing its impact with that of the physical network. We contextualise this by defining a collective learning problem in which agents must reach a consensus about their environment in the presence of noisy information. We show that the physical connectivity of the agents plays a less important role than when an interaction network of limited connectivity is imposed on the system to constrain agent communication. Constraining agent interactions in this way drastically improves the performance of the system in a collective learning context.

Establishing liveness in such systems is challenging, but such analysis will be necessary to apply such distributed traffic control algorithms in applications like coordinating robot swarms and the intelligent highway system. We present a formal model of a distributed traffic control protocol that guarantees minimum separation between entities, even as some cells fail. Once new failures cease occurring, in the case of a single target, the protocol is guaranteed to self-stabilize and the entities with feasible paths to the target cell make progress towards it. For multiple targets, failures may cause deadlocks in the system, so we identify a class of non-deadlocking failures where all entities are able to make progress to their respective targets. The algorithm relies on two general principles: temporary blocking for maintenance of safety and local geographical routing for guaranteeing progress. Our assertional proofs may serve as a template for the analysis of other distributed traffic control protocols.

There is widespread agreement that such an ambitious goal will be realized through a combination of innovative techniques involving different network layers. At the physical layer, the OFDM modulation format, along with its multiple-access strategy OFDMA, is not taken for granted, and several alternatives promising larger values of spectral efficiency are being considered. This paper provides a review of some modulation formats suited for 5G, enriched by a comparative analysis of their performance in a cellular environment, and by a discussion on their interactions with specific 5G ingredients. The interaction with a massive MIMO system is also discussed by employing real channel measurements.",cs.IT,2026-01-14 15:47:51.322000

The diversity of the vertical requirements as well as the particular features of the 5G network itself, make it a real challenge to be able to assess or predict applications performance for those verticals. In this paper we motivate the fact that because of the very nature of verticals and 5G infrastructure, measurements alone will not be sufficient for application performance monitoring and prediction. We then propose a comprehensive framework to integrate those measurements in a simulation setting, presenting the key features and current roadblocks for an end-to-end wide-spread implementation.",eess.SP,2026-01-14 15:47:51.326000
6967ac97e9ba439f2a893844,arXiv,5G Networks,Ultra-Reliable Communication in 5G Wireless Systems,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.4330v1,Petar Popovski,2014,"Wireless 5G systems will not only be ""4G, but faster"". One of the novel features discussed in relation to 5G is Ultra-Reliable Communication (URC), an operation mode not present in today's wireless systems. URC refers to provision of certain level of communication service almost 100 % of the time. Example URC applications include reliable cloud connectivity, critical connections for industrial automation and reliable wireless coordination among vehicles. This paper puts forward a systematic view on URC in 5G wireless systems. It starts by analyzing the fundamental mechanisms that constitute a wireless connection and concludes that one of the key steps towards enabling URC is revision of the methods for encoding control information (metadata) and data. It introduces the key concept of Reliable Service Composition, where a service is designed to adapt its requirements to the level of reliability that can be attained. The problem of URC is analyzed across two different dimensions. The first dimension is the type of URC problem that is defined based on the time frame used to measure the reliability of the packet transmission. Two types of URC problems are identified: long-term URC (URC-L) and short-term URC (URC-S). The second dimension is represented by the type of reliability impairment that can affect the communication reliability in a given scenario. The main objective of this paper is to create the context for defining and solving the new engineering problems posed by URC in 5G.","cs.IT, cs.NI",2026-01-14 15:47:51.331000
